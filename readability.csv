Infrastructure: The college has good Wi-Fi in each block around the campus. The only thing required to access it is the student registration number of the respective student, which will already be provided by the college during the admissions. Each course of the college is equipped with the latest materials and equipment to understand practically. The classrooms are just good and have a better environment to study and understand the classes, but the only drawback is that the benches are 4-seaters which is congesting. The hostel facilities are provided based on the necessities of students, but whatever the hostel we choose is worth the price we pay for it with good food and hygiene. Sports facilities in the college are quite less, and the sad thing is that we need to pay to play cricket even though we are from the college.

Faculty: The faculty are good at teaching, and they are qualified and complete the syllabus in time. They ensure that we understand the topics and the subject. Most professors are PhD holders from PES itself, while some have done it from IITs, NITs and IISC too. The course is curriculum relevant, and to be honest, it is advanced compared to other colleges, which is still advantageous for us. Semester exams are quite difficult, and we do not have any internal choice in the question papers. The internals are computer-based rather than pen-paper mode, but still the tough question paper makes us prepared for the worst.",73.51,19.460869565217394

Other: I opted for this course because of my interest in it and because it has a high demand in the future. The best thing about our course is that it is easy and provides many placements. Our college should provide more monitors for the lab. Our college conducts fests, quizzes, and extracurricular activities. Our college provides scholarships to students.",93.98,14.526368159203981
50,M S RAMAIAH ,6,2.4,"Placements: Placements are good enough in our college as it comes under tier-3 colleges. Also most of the recruits will consider it as a new college. As I'm seeing the outgoing batch they are just struggling to participate in interviews. I mean to say about 60% placements. Last year batch one of them got placed for 45 lacks in amazon. Average package will be around 7-10 lacks. The lowest package atleast 6 lacks. Majority of companies are other countries and apart from them amazon, cisco, tcs like companies are mostly visiting. Coming to the internships there is no discussion of it inside campus, we have to strive for the companies on our own if we are interested. Top roles can be web developers, data analyst, software developers, assistant analyst etc.

Infrastructure: First of all we have to discuss about the campus area being an university it has only 5 acres. Which is definitely very less than my school. Classes are great in one block as they are newly constructed and Wi-Fi availability is also for one block other blocks doesn't have Wi-Fi. For computer Science labs are very cheap and not maintained they are celeron computers. Yes there is one library which do not make to go there and read books. Hostel is partial with very less space and only one building for both boys and girls. Bad thing is their alliance STAR 555 PG which is out of campus, but with the name of college they are making parents and newly joining students fools. It is the worst PG for entire my life. Don't consider that PG for newly admitted students. Canteen is the worst no good facilities and items will be present and mess is like everytime people get changes then it tastes good otherwise same quality of food. Coming to sports don't dream about sports and games if you are decided to join MSRUAS. Because there is no such thing in the campus, for a formality they kept one small sports center which is always closed.

Faculty: Yes Faculty of computer Science and engineering is always good enough to say. Because most of the time when we get into new semester new faculty members will teach among them only one or two will be bad apart from that they have good teaching faculty and qualified teachers. Well there is neither discussion for any industry visits and nor about making students getting industry ready. So don't expect such things from this college. First of all don't compare with the MSRIT which is among top universities in india. Our college for Faculty of engineering not even present in NIRF ranking. So I mean to say faculty is not great but good enough. Best thing about the college is conducting exams manner they will take very seriously about every exam. And assignments also they will make sure that every student to submit. We have to be prepared well for exams otherwise there is no choice of passing in our college. Pass percentage depends on semester to semester as an average my course students get passed by 70% every semester for an average.

Other: To be frank I joined this course because definitely it's parents wish and for me at that time no option and events for our batch about 3 to 4 events per year I would like to say that there is less priority for events and extracurricular activities in our college and campus surroundings are dangerous we cannot come out after 7 pm because it's entirely industries out there. So I won't recommend mainly peenya campus for anyone.",78.02,15.649767132401866

The pass percentage of the previous academic year for my course was around 80 percent.

The best thing about my course is that it provides me with a wide angle view of the current industry and gives me a lot of options of different career paths to choose from. There is a lot of room for improvement in our college, starting with better recruitment of faculty with exceptional teaching skills, and improving infrastructure with built in technology, for the fees they take from students.
