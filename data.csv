PES UNIVERSITY,1,4.4,"Placements: Almost 90% of students got placed during this year's placements in ECE. The highest package offered is 25 LPA, and the average package is 11 LPA, and the lowest package is approximately 5 LPA. The top recruiting companies include Samsung, Qulacomm, NXP Semiconductors, Cadence and many others. 90% of students got internships during their pre-final and final years, while the rest of the students took up MOOC courses.

Infrastructure: The college has good Wi-Fi in each block around the campus. The only thing required to access it is the student registration number of the respective student, which will already be provided by the college during the admissions. Each course of the college is equipped with the latest materials and equipment to understand practically. The classrooms are just good and have a better environment to study and understand the classes, but the only drawback is that the benches are 4-seaters which is congesting. The hostel facilities are provided based on the necessities of students, but whatever the hostel we choose is worth the price we pay for it with good food and hygiene. Sports facilities in the college are quite less, and the sad thing is that we need to pay to play cricket even though we are from the college.

Faculty: The faculty are good at teaching, and they are qualified and complete the syllabus in time. They ensure that we understand the topics and the subject. Most professors are PhD holders from PES itself, while some have done it from IITs, NITs and IISC too. The course is curriculum relevant, and to be honest, it is advanced compared to other colleges, which is still advantageous for us. Semester exams are quite difficult, and we do not have any internal choice in the question papers. The internals are computer-based rather than pen-paper mode, but still the tough question paper makes us prepared for the worst."

PES UNIVERSITY,7,3.6,"Placements: Many opportunities are provided to students. The placement cell works very hard to ensure students know about these opportunities. The resources to help prepare for placements are also good. This university is well known for its good placements.

Infrastructure: It has labs, a library with Wi-Fi, 2 cafeterias, stationery supplies, and a playground. The girls' hostel is 4 kilometers away from the campus, while the boys' hostel is on campus. Students in the girls' hostel are provided with transportation, but it is quite hectic. The girls' hostel curfew is 6:30 PM and the current warden is strict. The rooms are decent. They accommodate four students in each room. Each room has one window and sufficient storage facilities. Study halls are present.

Faculty: The curriculum is relevant and interesting. The department does not have sufficient faculty members. Faculty members are good at teaching. Exams are challenging and require understanding the course well.

I would say that the overall stay in the hostel will be amazing and peaceful.

Faculty: All teachers in our department are Ph.D. holders. If not, they'll be given a chance to get their doctorates and return back and teach in the college. The teaching is very good. The curriculum is relevant if you're planning to appear for the government exams, the GATE exam, and the core placements such as NI, Schneider Electric, and others. It won't make us industry-ready. However, it would certainly show us the pathway for the preparation. The difficulty of the semester-end exams is moderate. The pass percentage is around 80-85%. Due to the fast-track facility, most of the students get a chance to clear their backlogs without actually having a stigma of backlogs in their mark cards.

M S RAMAIAH ,6,2.4,"Placements: Placements are good enough in our college as it comes under tier-3 colleges. Also most of the recruits will consider it as a new college. As I'm seeing the outgoing batch they are just struggling to participate in interviews. I mean to say about 60% placements. Last year batch one of them got placed for 45 lacks in amazon. Average package will be around 7-10 lacks. The lowest package atleast 6 lacks. Majority of companies are other countries and apart from them amazon, cisco, tcs like companies are mostly visiting. Coming to the internships there is no discussion of it inside campus, we have to strive for the companies on our own if we are interested. Top roles can be web developers, data analyst, software developers, assistant analyst etc.

Infrastructure: First of all we have to discuss about the campus area being an university it has only 5 acres. Which is definitely very less than my school. Classes are great in one block as they are newly constructed and Wi-Fi availability is also for one block other blocks doesn't have Wi-Fi. For computer Science labs are very cheap and not maintained they are celeron computers. Yes there is one library which do not make to go there and read books. Hostel is partial with very less space and only one building for both boys and girls. Bad thing is their alliance STAR 555 PG which is out of campus, but with the name of college they are making parents and newly joining students fools. It is the worst PG for entire my life. Don't consider that PG for newly admitted students. Canteen is the worst no good facilities and items will be present and mess is like everytime people get changes then it tastes good otherwise same quality of food. Coming to sports don't dream about sports and games if you are decided to join MSRUAS. Because there is no such thing in the campus, for a formality they kept one small sports center which is always closed.

Faculty: Yes Faculty of computer Science and engineering is always good enough to say. Because most of the time when we get into new semester new faculty members will teach among them only one or two will be bad apart from that they have good teaching faculty and qualified teachers. Well there is neither discussion for any industry visits and nor about making students getting industry ready. So don't expect such things from this college. First of all don't compare with the MSRIT which is among top universities in india. Our college for Faculty of engineering not even present in NIRF ranking. So I mean to say faculty is not great but good enough. Best thing about the college is conducting exams manner they will take very seriously about every exam. And assignments also they will make sure that every student to submit. We have to be prepared well for exams otherwise there is no choice of passing in our college. Pass percentage depends on semester to semester as an average my course students get passed by 70% every semester for an average.

Other: To be frank I joined this course because definitely it's parents wish and for me at that time no option and events for our batch about 3 to 4 events per year I would like to say that there is less priority for events and extracurricular activities in our college and campus surroundings are dangerous we cannot come out after 7 pm because it's entirely industries out there. So I won't recommend mainly peenya campus for anyone."

Software Engineer/Jr software engineer. The top recruiting companies are - Capgemini, Cognizant, Genpact, Earnst and Young, EXL Service, TCS The placement training doesn't really equip the students with the industry expectations.

Infrastructure: Labs are average and are equipped with a LAN. Classrooms are basic with school like infrastructure. The faculty is not to the level of the standard the college has been ranked in national level rankings. Library has a 24x7 study hall with seperate rooms for peer study groups. One down side of these discussion rooms is that we are allowed to use it only during the day, and not after the sun Sets which makes them of not much use. There is a library area where books can be issued. Library could have been a bit more spacious with newer editions of books, and much more world classy. There is one cafe, where we get almost everything from snacks to lunch. And there is a Udupi hotel too. There is one more snacks and Chinese food outlet and a Nescafe stall. The sports ground is large enough to play football, and there are 2 volleyball courts, a kabbadi court, an outdoor basketball court, and an indoor basketball and badminton court.

Faculty: The faculty can be said to be well qualified with Masters and doctorate degrees, but when it comes to their teaching, it isn't that great. Infact, YouTube and other online courses help us a lot more than the faculty itself. The course curriculum is up to date, but not in depth. We have to study in depth on our own for placements and competitions. The curriculum is basic enough to give the students an idea of the subjects and makes them not completely industry ready. The semester exams are not that difficult since it is an autonomous college. The pass percentage is less relatively even when the exams are not that difficult. The pass percentage of the previous academic year for my course was around 80 percent.

Other: I chose the course because I wanted to pursue a career in the IT industry and my love for computers. The best thing about my course is that it provides me with a wide angle view of the current industry and gives me a lot of options of different career paths to choose from. There is a lot of room for improvement in our college, starting with better recruitment of faculty with exceptional teaching skills, and improving infrastructure with built in technology, for the fees they take from students. Extracurricular activities take the main seat in our college, there are these activities going on all the year round, and we have fests and events on a regular basis, which is no doubt a good exposure to socializing and having fun. The college being built in a small 11 acre land makes it look a bit crowded."
