PES University,"Remarks : I got a mechanical branch on merit via the CET exam. Application forms and fees and dates can be found on college websites. The admission process is very good as it was one the top college's in Bangalore and highly maintained
Course Curriculum Overview : I had an interest in machines, motors and the craze of it working so chose this branch. Faculty were highly qualified and relationship with students was good. As I said it's one of the renowned colleges it includes some great PhD holders faculty and other high qualifications too. Exams were conducted semester wise and internal were medium-level difficulty, Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : My branch didn't have that much hike and as I was selected for merit admission so government-quoted fees were all I needed to pay. Scholarships were given to rankers with extraordinary scores. Financial assistance was given to some who couldn't afford it
Campus Life : Annual fest and tech fest were conducted once in 6 months it was so fun where could explore and showcase our talents. The library is very big and almost famous authors' publications could be found. Sports was given also a priority in our college and extracurricular activities were conducted to make students show their talent and many social groups were present in our college such as the welfare club, Leo club etc",10,11,7.5,63.12,21.59855422,-1,0
PES University,"Remarks : I had taken a KCET entrance exam which had of cutoff ranking of 2000 for qualifying in pes electricity campus for computer science engineering. The admission process requires you to show your kcet marks sheet which needs to be asserted along with your 10th and 12th-grade mark sheet. Once the required documents along with passport photos are submitted I had to pay a fee of 1,10,000 in the form of a demand draft to the admission office. Once done they assigned me a unique roll number and some goodies. Later I had to collect my id card on the day PES university starts. Improvement that can be done is to pay fees via online neft (which has been implemented now).
Course Curriculum Overview : I love computer coding so I went towards the domain of computer science engineering. There is sufficient faculty to handle around 1k students each year. It would be better if more teachers are present. Some teachers have a qualified doctorate and some teachers are very good in the subject they teach. There are few teachers whose teaching is the worst. I had to learn some subjects on my own. There is 5 internals for each unit which is MCQ based and trust me that is not a good way to conduct exams as we face a problem during our final which is theory-based. With the burden of projects for every subject, it is a lot to handle for a student. The difficulty of passing is medium as it is a relative grading based on the highest marks scored.
Internships Opportunities : Various companies like Walmart, American express, fractal analytics, Goldmann Sachs, and morgan Stanley come for internships ranging from 50k to 1lakh per month for roles like software engineer, technology analyst, application developer etc.
Placement Experience : Students in the final year are eligible for internships and campus placement. Students in the third and second years are eligible for only internships. Various companies like Infosys, cisco, morgan Stanley, Goldmann Sachs, Samsung and around 200+ companies come to campus for placements. The highest package that has come in my batch was around 30lpa and the average package of 9lpa. Around 90+% students are into some or the other companies. My plans after getting a degree are to have workable experience at it companies and then pursue a master's.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : Fees are a bit high for students who don't come via kcet. For kcet people, it is around 1,10,000 rupees which include 48,000 for university infrastructure (actually the PES university looks good). Apart from that you do get three types of scholarships i.e 1. CNRao Scholarship(25% of your fees)- Top 20% of students in terms of GPA (every semester) 2. MRD Scholarship(20% of your fees)- Students achieving 8.5 + cgpa per semester. I have mrd scholarship for a few semesters and remaining semester I didn't receive it because of covid it was removed. My dad had sufficient money to pay for my college so there was no problem with financial assistance. I got a job at Unbxd via campus placement offering me a stipend of a 15lpa package.
Campus Life : Life on campus is good. There are various circular activities like hackathons, quiz maina etc. It will be more fun if you are at our campus (they have lot more events than ec campus). We have an annual fest held during the month of October-November. There are a sufficient number of books at the library for reference and you get access to the digital library (containing books, research papers, and previous years' qps for every course) if you are a PES university student. Every classroom had a large tv to project slides presented by the professor and large blackboards. It has also sufficient benches (three students per bench can suffice the entire strength of the classroom). It has many cupboards for you to keep some extra accessories (not your college bags). There are a lot of sports activities going on every semester like table tennis, cricket(a large cricket ground), football, volleyball, badminton court etc. There are a lot of social groups run by students you can check the pes university link for more details.",6,8,7.2,76.66,18.00020101,-2,0
PES University,"Remarks : I took admission through KCET and based on my raking I got admission here. Application for Kcet can be found on their website. I didn't avail reservations but there are reservations. You can also get admission through its private exam.
Course Curriculum Overview : Faculties are good courses that are all helpful for placement each sem has credits of 22-24 depending for three years and fourth year based on project and internship with some electives a total of 160 credits is required.
Internships Opportunities : JP Morgan Microsoft DE shaw and many more I, for now, have no idea of companies that come to college for internships and Jp morgan offered a 70k package per month for internship. Whereas Microsoft has offered 1.25L.
Placement Experience : 5th-semester companies start coming in. In our college companies like google Microsoft jp morgan Deshaw and many more tier one companies come. Many startups also come. The average package for CSE is nearly 10L. Many students even opt for higher studies.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : The fee structure varies for a different type of admission for kcet it's 1.1 lakh for pessat exam students it's 3.3 for my batch and there is also management seat options for this fee excluding hostel. For the top 20 percent of students, they get a 20 percent tuition fee waiver.
Campus Life : The annual fest is named MAYA since there was a covid for two years we didn't have a fest this year we have it in the month of October. The library is decent you can find only course-related books and also gre cat GMAT exam books.",6,6,7.7,74.74,18.58313817,0,0
PES University,"Remarks : Eligibility for the course Is 60 per cent marks in maths and science in 10th and 12th. The application form can be found on the pes website. The application fee is 1050 rupees and the last date to apply for Pessat is 16th June for students who want to write in Bangalore.
Course Curriculum Overview : I chose computer science and engineering since the course curriculum is similar to industry topics and most of the faculty are PhD scholars. There is a good relationship maintained between faculty and student. Term exams are done every 4 to 5 months. It was very difficult to pass if we didn't attend classes properly.
Internships Opportunities : The companies that gave internship opportunities are jp Morgan, IBM, Infosys, and many more. The roles offered are backend developer, frontend developer, Web developer, software developer and many more.
Placement Experience : Students who have completed the 6th semester will become eligible for campus placements. There are almost 200 companies visited and around 500 offers were made. The highest package was 60 lakh per annum for a third-year student and 1.6 crores per annum for a final-year student. The average package is 10 lakh per annum. Almost 80 per cent of students are getting placed. My plan after getting a degree is to get a good placement.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : Fees per annum are 3.3 lakh and if a student is in the top 20 per cent that student will be getting a 40 per cent wavier in the fee. Campus placements are done after the third year and the average package is 10 lakh per annum.
Campus Life : The annual fest is called Aatmatrisha and Maaya. Aatmatrisha is conducted in the month of April and maaya is conducted in the month of September or October. There are a lot of books available in the library and they can also be accessed through the pes library portal. There are inter-department matches conducted every year. And these matches are organised by the college management. There are many clubs and social groups for students run by students.",4,3,7.6,79.51,16.77371391,1,0
PES University,"Remarks : admissions to PESU has 3 modes, one is through KCET 2nd option is through PESSAT which is an entrance exam to join for PESU and the last option is through the management quota. If you want to join through KCET without any quota then your rank should be below 1.5-3k for CSE and around 5-9k for ECE(you may wonder that the cutoff of pesu is higher than RVCE, MSRIT and BMSCE that's because the intake of PESU is more compared to other colleges as it is a university) The admission process is very easy you have to fill an online application and you need to submit other documents(such as KCET order copy, marks card, income and caste certificate and if you are from CBSE OR ICSE then you have to provide a migration certificate) and they will verify it.
Course Curriculum Overview : The course curriculum is very latest unlike the vtu curriculum and every year they will change the course curriculum by at least 15-20% just to give an update about the industrial needs and according to it, they change the course. The faculty members are pretty experienced and knowledgeable and they are nither student friendly nor very strict but they will clarify your doubts at any time and even the teaching is good and most of the faculty members did their MTech, PhD in reputed institutions(like IITs, IISc) and they conduct internals twice in a semester unlike vtu which conduct thrice in a semester and previously internals were in online mode(i.e CBT) but now due to covid the internals are in pen paper mode and internals will be easy but the ESAs(sem exams) will be difficult
Internships Opportunities : Students from pesu have done their internships from top companies and 1283 students of 6th semester had virtual internships during the pandemic with them receiving monthly stipneds ranging from 15k-87k and the highest stipend offered was around 1.3L per month and internship offers are good and the conversion rate to pre-placement offers are over 90% and note that everyone won't get the ineternships from college side some has to find it themselves.
Placement Experience : Placement is the best part in PESU, it is one of the best in Karnataka and placement starts in 7th sem and most of the tier 1 company make 7.5 CGPA as the cutoff and placement is excellent for CSE, very good for ECE and the highest placement of this year(2021) is 1.5cr for a CSE student and for ECE its around 35-45L and at least some 130 companies visit our campus every year
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : fees structure: KCET- around 110000 per year (62k cet fees,48k college fees that include everything even exam fees) PESSAT- around 380000-400000 per year. Management - around 7-8L for CSE,6-7L for ECE,4-5L for MECH. Hostel- 135000(1L is the actual fees and 35k is refundable amount). Scholarship: you are free to apply for any government or private scholarship *RS 1k if your SGPA is above 7.75 *MHRD scholarship-if a student is among the top 20% of his/her class in terms of CGPA for a particular academic year they will get a tuition fee waiver of 40%. CNR Rao scholarship- 50% tuition fee waiver for toppers.
Campus Life : campus life is good, PESU doesn't organise many cultural activities. the annual event- MAYA in every odd sem. activities-inter department sports matches,hackathon,seminar,webinar. infrastructure-labs,library,parking space,wifi,gym,football ground,cricket ground,basketball court,badminton court,volleyball court.
Hostel Facilities : I don't know about hostel facilities as I am a day scholar but the hostel fees are around 1.35L hand the 35k is refundable and if you feel hostel fees are higher than what you expected then you can rent a pg, there are lots of PGs are here and they are as far as 0.5km-1.5km away from college and I heard that the food quality in the hostel is good.",5,5,8.6,70.76,22.66758102,0,0
PES University,"Remarks : In 2016, Comed K used to have physical counseling in Bangalore. So, I had applied for Dayanand Sagar, Nitte Meenakshi, and PES. I chose PES as it was the best among them. There were no such criteria as minimum marks in Comed K. According to the marks you have achieved, there will be some colleges in that marks range. The process was very smooth. They call you as per your ranks and then you get a big screen which shows live availability of seats. You just have to choose from that and make a payment to book the seat.
Course Curriculum Overview : I basically chose this course because that was the only one left in PES and Mech from PES is probably the best you can get in Bangalore. Student to faculty ratio would be somewhere around 1:10. The teaching method is almost the same as all other colleges and it will depend on your teacher how he approaches the subject. Some teachers are highly qualified. For eg. I had a Physics teacher in 1st year who was a PhD holder from IISc and now he is doing Post Doctoral Studies in Ethiopia. Exams are conducted every month in the form of Internal Assessments. They have weightage in your final semester aggregate. The exams are generally moderate to difficult.
Placement Experience : Students are generally eligible from the 7th sem provided they don't have any backlogs. Many companies including several big ones like Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Amazon, Google visit the campus every year. The main campus gets placed entirely in 2 months with most students having multiple offers. Highest packages offered usually stays higher than 50 lakhs. This year it was 1.5 crore. If you include all the branches, more than 90 % students get placed. I'm planning to enter the government sector.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : Fees will remain same throughout the course Every new hike is generally implemented for the upcoming batches and not the existing ones. So, that is one good thing. My college recently became a University. So, they charge a lot of money now. But it's worth it because Placements have skyrocketed for PES as it has become a brand now. Anybody from the lower-income bracket or SC/ST/OBC is eligible for scholarships every academic year. Placements are exceptional for Computer Science with most of the students bagging 2 offers.
Campus Life : Maya is the annual college fest and it is conducted around the month of October. As far as other events are concerned. There is a department-specific event every year like Ingenius for CS, Kludge for ECE, Vinyasa for Mech. The PES library is quite big spread over 2 floors. You can find course-related books here. The classrooms have OLED TVs installed which the teachers use for presentations. Activity Day is conducted every year which includes many sports activities like Volley Ball, Cricket, Basketball, Badminton. The college has its own separate Cricket Ground. There are many clubs like Entrepreneurship, Automobile, and Aviation clubs like Avions. With the new curriculum, it has become compulsory for students to be a part of at least one club.. So there are even more clubs now.
Hostel Facilities : The boy's hostel is inside the college campus whereas the girl's hostel is a few kilometers away. You will get attached bathrooms in Boy's Hostel whereas common bathrooms in the Girl's hostel. Four meals are usually provided in a day. There is a lot of variety though. Curfew restrictions might be a hurdle sometimes. The registration process is also a little cumbersome as they will ask you to get the signatures of your parents at the time of annual fees submission. So, you will have to send the forms by post to home and get them back. I moved out after 3 years and the area around college is good and well populated with many options for accommodation.",3,1,7.6,81.77,15.48101211,2,0
PES University,"Remarks : I came to heard about this college from my brother who works at Microsoft through his friend who studied here. So, it is fair to say, job offers are fairly good from tier 1 companies for CSE undergraduates.
Course Curriculum Overview : Course syllabus is very basic. Exposure to different varieties of subjects is fully expected. There might be some subjects which don't interest you at all, as was in my case. But it is only a matter of time when a subject of your choice will be available to enroll for. There are online notes for every course which u can peruse through right before exams with ease. In my 1st year, faculty was disappointing for a majority of the subjects, not all. So I would suggest, do not be dependent on the faculty.
Placement Experience : Abundant number of companies visit PES every year ranging from global to local. In the CSE branch, there is a higher chance of bagging a bumper package/tier 1 job offer. Placement process is systematic. The staff at placement department are helpful and cheerful. Entrepreneurship cell never keeps a student in the dark. There are constant notifications and seminars within the cell.
College Events : There are many events ranging from technical to cultural. In my 1st semester, there were roughly, 5-6 of these events. Be it a 24 hr Hackathon or innovative contests for each branch or cultural fests, there was no shortage of entertainment. The participation is fairly good as there is encouragement for winning merchandise and goodies. Overall, with friends these events are plenty of fun and galore.
Campus Life : On campus WiFi facility is non-existent. Gym is nothing but a room with weights and some equipment. Library and labs are far better than any of the other facilities. Library has 2 floors worth of books which you can ask for a limited number of time. There abundant number of labs throughout the whole campus.",8,3,7.3,81.63,16.64,5,0
PES University,"Remarks : Overall the college is good and disciplined. It should provide incentives for students who are publishing papers and winning awards. College doesn't provide funds even for the cultural or technical fests. Students have to get the sponsors for the same and pay any fees required for publishing a technical paper.
Course Curriculum Overview : Course Curriculum and Exam Structure is as per the standards in IITs and NITs. The prescribed books are also the same. Overall the course curriculum focuses more on the theory knowledge imparted from books and very less practical applications are taught in college. I can't say that it is research driven at all but it is fair to all the students and the experience shared by the faculties surely adds value to us being professional. Learning Imparted as part of curriculum was not enough to crack any interview and all students has to put extra effort in order to do so. The curriculum is not at all groomed to provide any industry specific knowledge. Its up to the teachers if they want to impart some knowledge of their professional career to us. To secure on-campus selection we had to practice competitive coding online and practice basic aptitude. Industrial visits are organised every semester which is of little help to some people but not everyone.
Fee Structure And Facilities : College accepts NEFT and Demand Drafts only. The college provides complete transparency in the fee-breakdown. My program fees was 70000 per year which was feasible for my parents. The additional charges are Exam fees, Stationary fees, Convocation fees, tution fees, college fees.Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : I was given a scholarship of 50,000 every year by the govt. of Karnataka. I was eligible for this scholarship because my father is in Indian Air Force. To avail the scholarship I had to fill the online application and submit the acknowledgement in the college office. So overall my fees for 4 years of engineering was 80,000 rupees. There are other kind of scholarships given to students from various other background but no scholarship based on academic performance. Although people who secured 1st division did receive as cheque of 500 rupees every semester.
Campus Life : Gender Ratio depends entirely on the branch. In computer science the boys to girls ratio is around 3:2 while in mechanical, the ratio is 100:1. Their are short functions held during lunch break every week before the cultural fest. The major fest is Maaya that happens every odd semester and other that we have an activity day every even semester. There is VTU Sports Competitions every year and also inter departmental sports competitions as part of activity day. Labs are available in the college for all the courses offered by the college. Apart from all these there the various clubs like Equinox, Math club, IEEE etc. which held activities like quizzes, debates and many other with some prize money. Student community is diverse with a combination of people from all states across India. There is no exploitation with respect to all the rights given by constitution.
Hostel Facilities : For first 2 years I was in college hostel and the fees at that time was 95000 which included food, rent, electricity bill, water bill, laundry. For First year students a separate hostel is available at 4 km away from college. College provides commute for those students. Here, each room is shared by 4 students and beds are one above the other. Common dining room and bathrooms are present. And there is a small gym and play area with a short football ground and 2 basketball courts, Wifi is available. 2nd year onward we are shifted to in-campus hostel in which each room is shared by 3 students. All college facilities including library are available for students staying in college hostel. Outside college at around 1 km many PGs for both boys and girls are available at prices around 8000 rupees. There are also apartments available at some distance from the college.
Alumni/Alumna : Alumni network is available on telegram and linkedin where we can connect with our seniors and ask for any kind of help. Many are helpful and responds to our queries.
Admission : I got admitted to the college through Karnataka Common Entrance Test in the year 2016. The test was held a month after 12th board exams and the admission process started in July. After I secured a decent rank of 5313 in KCET, I got this college. The admission process was smooth. First I had to go to KEA office in Malleshwaram for document verification and later to college for the admission process. All documents were submitted to college at the time of admission and I received an acknowledgement for the same. And I was good to attend college from Aug 1st. I chose the Computer Science and Engineering stream after realising that the new era is going to be completely dependent on computers and this course will help me getting into a good company in Bangalore. Other than this there were seniors who told me about the lack of job situation for other branches of engineering. I chose this college because it was the best I could get given my rank and the branch I desired.
Faculty : Every subject has one teacher assigned for that particular semester. So atleast 8 teachers per semester if we are counting the practicals and labs as well. Average age would be around 40 years and almost all are post graduates. A few are PhD as well. Hierarchy mainly has 3 levels. Associate professors, Assistant Professors and Head of Department. And of course the Principal. A few teachers are really good at what they teach but most of them don't know how to teach even if they have the technical knowledge. The subjects taught by the teachers in class is of very less use if you are not doing any self study. If you are asking doubt out of the textbook, probably you will have to tell the answer to the class the next day. Although some teachers make that extra effort. Some of the faculties do have industry experience which they do share and it does motivates you to enter the corporate world but obviously it differs from person to person.",9,9,6,71.66,16.32392176,0,0
PES University,"Remarks : It's a great place for learning. A student friendly environment. just need to concentrate on professional development of students
Course Curriculum Overview : Vtu syllabus doesn't exactly help you in making professionally sound. it's your skills that does. It just the theory which is in syllabus. which doesn't exactly help you in improving your skills. than the mugging up content it's better to concentrate on programming language development practically
Placement Experience : Yes placement is 90% I can say.There are alot of companies who visit for recruitment. Great support from the institution in placements
College Events : Alot of events were held. like sports. inter college competition. Picnic,outing, intra college competition,quiz, Fairless cooking, antakshri,treasure hunt, craft workshop, Create a student mentorship program,Solo” night hike,workshop where students can make their own dorm room décor — think plant hangers, terrariums, or recycled frames for their art.
Fee Structure And Facilities : The program fee if gon through the cet counseling is not very costly. whereas if it's through management quota it's a little high they provide hostel bus facility. The fee breakdown is clearly mentioned no hide and seek in it. it's transparent. There are no other cost.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : Yes opted for scholarship through various sources like. merit cum means scholarship. you need to apply for this after your admission
Campus Life : Yes the campus to look itself is amazing alot of competition were held. they develop leadership qualities, debates were held on various topics for interhouse competition,labs are well equipped. There is discrimination no ragging in the campus. Canteen facility is available
Alumni/Alumna : Yes they have a alumini network where job vacancy and new eventa are posted. Also the alumini are kept in network for job availability
Admission : Through CET counseling. Initially after the cet results you get a date on which your counselling happens depending on your rank on that particular day you get to choose for the college that falls in your ranking range. After selecting your processed further to colege.
Faculty : The faculty helps you in teaching the contents required for that particular semester. they do complete the portions. all the faculty are expertise. but could be more beneficial if thought keeping students in mind. And there learning capabilities. The number of lectures were plenty",6,10,9.2,74.69,17.94466231,-4,0
PES University,"Remarks : Decent College which is more Academic centered and strict but definitely improving. Slow changes are being made to improve the course and the entire structure is being made modernised. The professor pool is still a bit lacklustre.
Course Curriculum Overview : The first year of B tech is course independent. Students of all departments follow a single curriculum and there are no electives to choose from, which makes it seem like another year of high school. There are 2 internals which are computer based followed by a written exam in the end of the semester. The course content is spaced averagely which makes it neither too hectic or chilled.
Placement Experience : The average placement package is around 6 -7 lakhs per annually The 4th year is mostly filled with internships and students have the option to start as early as the 1 year summer holidays. Companies that recruit include microsoft, amazon.etc
College Events : There is an annual cultural fest followed by many other events hosted by various clubs including but not restricted to various hackathons and ideathons. Also an annual event named activity day is carried out where the various departments compete against each other.
Fee Structure And Facilities : The base fees is feasible compared to others, and there are scholarships available to meritorious students. The fees for students who entered through PESSAT is set at 3.2lakhs for the year(2019) but for those students who entered through KCET its around 1.2lakhs.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : There are 2 major scholarships based on the cgpa secured by student in their first year which cuts off a percentage on their total fee for that academic year. The first one is awarded to the top 10% of the students and the fee is waived by 25% The second one is awarded to all students who have secured and upwards of 8.2 cgpa and above a fee waiver of 15% along with certificate is awarded.
Campus Life : The labs are decently equipped and is being improved upon. The gender ratio is not too bad a ratio of 1:3 of girls to boys. Frequent workshops are organized by seniors. A strict rule against raging has made accounts of bullying almost next to none.
Hostel Facilities : The hostel for first year is pretty strict, a lot of restrictions. Overall it's a better choice to scout out a PG or rent an apartment with your friends. Although there are a lot of facilities such as laundry and wifi but the 6.30 in time constricts a lot of activities you can partake in.
Alumni/Alumna : There is a pretty good alumni network with many of them having their own successfull startup who occasionally come and provide insights. A lot of students have started actively being part of various tech networks and host frequent seminars on upcoming tech.
Admission : The admission process involves writing the College entrance exam named PESSAT, and based on ranking the courses are allotted. The course CSE was in my line of interest which prompted me to pressure the said course. The Admission process is pretty straightforward, based on your ranking your called to choose your course. The further your rank, the lesser options you get.
Faculty : Some of the faculty carry pretty high qualification and were actively part of the industry and hence provide insight on how the industry works in their respective fields. But the ratio of good professors is pretty low, especially in the first 2 semesters. Hence, the majority of the subjects in the first year feels lackluster since not only are they forced upon you but most of the professors are not upto the mark.",7,12,6.5,74.19,19.76915423,-5,0
PES University,"Remarks : Overall the college is a pretty good on the academics aspects but if one talks about aspects other than academic aspects such as cocurricular then the college really lags behind other contemporary private colleges
Course Curriculum Overview : The course curriculum according to me is up to date according to latest trends and standards.But the college exam structure is set in such a way that it makes college life a bit hectic for the students
Placement Experience : Placements of the college are actually good as far as I have heard from seniors.Nearly everyone who sit in the placement gets placed.Also internships oppurtunites are provided, few in the second year, but mostly in first year
College Events : The college is a bit more focussed on its technical events than its cultural ones.The college holds its annual technocultural college fest called Maaya in the odd semester and Activity Day in the even semester.
Fee Structure And Facilities : The fees according to me is a bit expensive for PESSAT quota students at 3.2 LPA than the other contemporary private colleges.The events conducted by the college and campus life should turn the fees a bit lower.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : There are various scholarships provided by the college for the students who acheive merit in college semester exams.for exam top 20 percent students from each sem are given a fee waiver of 25 percent from the total fees of the semester.
Campus Life : The college is generally less focussed on extracocurricular but yeah encourages students to do things out of the college course.Many workshops are conducted.Gender ratio is pretty healthy at 2:1.Although the no of college societies are a bit less.
Alumni/Alumna : The alumni network of PES University is known to be good.The seniors of the college are also really friendly and helpful.They often guide through the college system and encourage us to take part in various extracocurricular activities.
Admission : I gave the PESSAT exam, an all india engineering entrance exam for admission to PES University.My rank was around 1200 in that exam through which I managed a seat in the electronic City campus of the college.
Faculty : Faculty of the college is decent.While some are really good, some cannot deliver well what they are supposed to teach.The faculties of the college are often a bit strict about attendance and discipline factors.",5,8,8.2,65.86,19.0781982,-3,0
PES University,"Remarks : The college rules were bit strict. Our college was very strict in terms of attendance percentage which was 85% at the end of semester where many students struggle to maintain 85% attendance and pay fine for not maintaining the attendance
Course Curriculum Overview : I took mechanical engineering as my branch in BE which I was very passionate about. The lectures were very good in our bramch. Our college was officiated to VTU. So the course curriculum was according to vtu process and the exam pattern was also according to VTU Rules only
Placement Experience : Placement was good. Placements starts in the 6th semester itself. Placements are very good for Computer Science department but for mechanical engineering department placements were not that good. So mechanical engineering students also attend IT company since very few mechanical companies come for placements

College Events : Department wise competitions were conducted every where students can showcase their talent. College level feast was conducted every year for which students starts preparing before one month the event starts
Fee Structure And Facilities : The fees is very less for Cet condidates. But for Management students it is very expensive. Fees forCet students will be around 60000 including cet fees but management students it will be around 4 lakhs
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : College doesn't provide any scholarship but they help is to apply for scholarship provided by the state government. They will send the notice to class well in advance to apply for scholarship.
Campus Life : The sports room was full of sports equipment We had GYM facilities also which was very useful for students to develop their body. We were allowed to sports room only during the sports period since PE teacher was very strict
Alumni/Alumna : The seniors were very helpful they use to refer us to companies when we were in final year. The seniors were very encouraging and help to prepare for any inter college competition. I had very good friendship with the seniors
Admission : I wrote get exam after puc and then I got seat in pesit through cet counseling and then I took the admission order and reported to the college. The admission process was very smooth. The office staff were very helpful.
Faculty : The lectures were very friendly. They use to give us very good suggestions. They were always ready to clear our doibts. They were ready to stay even after the office hours if we ask any doubts. They were ready to any number of times until we understand",7,12,8.7,70.32,16.55288254,-5,0
PES University,"Remarks : College is good in terms of academics overall and specially ECE lets you face all up's and down's takes you through a adventurous journey. But yes cultural activities are not much encouraged. But it is sure that there are many things going to improve this area along with academics.
Course Curriculum Overview : I being admitted to the college in the year 2017 come under VTU Curriculum,and the last batch of VTU Curriculum from PESU ECC.Now,the curriculum has been changed to PES University curriculumn.So,whosever has been admitted to the college from the year 2018 is under PES University,i.e it has become an autonomous institute,with its main branch in Banashankari.The Course of university is really a very good one,it takes care of all the recent advancements,gives scope of research as at the end of each semester there are projects to be done.The labs are held every weak and need deep understanding of the subject to be done.Exams are held in a very systematic way as the internals are computer based test with MCQ's,externals are written.The exams really need deep understanding of the subject.A policy of relative marking is practised.ECE labs are well equipped and the best support is given by the teachers and not spoon feeding.
Placement Experience : Placements are good,almost everyone gets placed.Internships are not actually provided by the college but sufficient guidance,time is given for internships.As there is only 1st year and 2nd year under Pes curriculum as they were admitted to college in 2018 and ahead.So,I am not sure of placement and internship oppurtunities lying ahead.But placements for ECC campus students are held along with the main campus students,hence we need to compete with main campus students for placements.

College Events : This is were the college holds a step back,there are not many cultural fests at a large scale,there are good amount of technical events held every semesters,not many management festivals are held.The technical events have a good participation and result.
Fee Structure And Facilities : Fees structure is little expensive,and is taken on the yeraly basis.The base fees recommended by the govt+additional fees of around Rs 50000/- is taken.This is just a round figure it changes often.Examination fee is also included in it.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : I din;t listen anything of loans being offered so far.But many scholarships are given on merit basis every semester and other scholarships are entertained and supported by the college.Students can apply for scholarships offered by govt.
Campus Life : There are extra curricular activities held in the college but not many.There are sports meet held almost once every semester.Various workshops and competitons like fresh face etc.Gender ratio is pretty good.There are various clubs coming up and developing at a very good pace.
Hostel Facilities : I opted for a hostel facility,there are two hostels one inside the campus and one outside the campus around 7km away from the campus.The out campus hostel has girls hostel and a hostel for 1st year boys.The in campus hostel is only for boys from 2nd year to 4th year,The outcampus hostel has a very good infrastructure.There are only 4 & 6 occupancy rooms but are well organized with bunker beds and table,cupboard for each person.The infrastructure is the best.The food is good,not bad or great.Breakfast,Lunch,Snacks and dinner is served on all days and a mini feast once in a month.Hostel has a laundry facility and washing machine,small gym,induction for self cooking,The girls hostel has 6:30 pm as the curfew time.Security tops the priority list.
External Expense : Rs.2000 - Rs.4000
Alumni/Alumna : Yeah,alumni often visit us various events or visit us for a talk and share their experiences with us,they make us feel more connected and give strength that we too can do it,because they did it.They give us a confidence.It is also said that a strong alumni network is being created to revise and look into the syllabus and communicate with students.
Admission : got admitted to the college through a state entrance exam K-CET, which is specially for karnataka students but allows others state student to write given some criteria which can be checked on the kea website.After the exam is being taken by the student, the result is announced.The result of the exam depends on the exam score and 12th grade percentage.The ranks are allocated on merit basis.A list of colleges with their codes is released by the exam board(kea).Student has to prepare a priority list of colleges they want to apply along with course and submit it.Then, a document verification process is carried out at various centres.The admissions to colleges applied are given based on ranks and vacancies available.Once a seat is allocated, accepted by the student, admission form is released which has to be filled and admission fee has to paid, a date is given within which the student should be reporting to the college with all necesaary documents, and his admission is confirmed.For more details about examination and its detailed procedure. https://cetonline.karnataka.gov.in/kea/
Faculty : The ECE faculty is very good.As the college has just adopted the university curriculumn teachers are not yet familiar to it,but yes,they are working 24/7 for the betterment,and i am sure ECE department would surpass the main branch soon.",6,2,7,77.5,16.79782303,4,0
PES University,"Remarks : No. negative remarks. Positive remarks. Every student make himself independent and punctual. Every student himself has to make his own notes.
Course Curriculum Overview : Good. General pattern. Just like other general engineering exams. Little tough and basics and knowledge worthy question paper. Need regular practice to score better and to get top level need to study deep in the subject.
Placement Experience : The placement and job are 95%. Students get packages in placement. College doesn't provide any internship but for every students in the fourth year internship is must and should for 2 months. Its mandatory for getting degree.

College Events : Every college fest Maya is celebrated. Hatchon, workshops are conducted for the student development. Every branch have their way of events in even semesters. And also inter college department competition held in evensemeter.
Fee Structure And Facilities : Feasible for cet students. Expensive for comedk and management students. I feel like fees structure should be changed and it should be equal for both cet and comedk students as they both are through entrance exam.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : I don't know about both. Cet students get scholarships from government. Loan can be get from bank if need any assistance college provides. Bank interest is high for loans.
Campus Life : There is regular competition for all sports and good encouragement from sports coach. Regularly practice can be done. Coach helps in improvemet. State and national completions are also held.
Alumni/Alumna : There won't be any such things. You can get any information from seniors. It is help to know more about college. It is better always to enquire about college before joining.
Admission : Through comedk counselling, I got the merit rank and during the counselling I selected this college as it is one of the best college in karnataka and it provides good education and develops quality education.
Faculty : They are well experienced. Always thinks students development and helps for the student in the specific knowledge subjects more so that they can make themselevs better in the subject. Faculty always teaches in the way students understand.",2,1,7.7,85.35,15.35686275,1,0
PES University,"Remarks : Overall, I would call it an average college. There is a lot of focus on just the academic perspective of the students. But I strongly believe that this could have been much, much better. At least provide the students enough holidays so that they can do some meaningful internships. There could be a little bit more importance given to cultural fests because let's are honest, we are not machines. A little bit of fun wouldn't hurt. But that doesn't stop me from appreciating all the technical events that are held with a lot of excitement. And of course, the placements are one of the best in the city.
Placement Experience : My college is considered to be the best place to get the best placement offers. The placement cell is pretty strong and efficient. And there is almost a 99% rate of placement in the college. And as far as I know, my college provides an internship only to the toppers. The rest of us need to look around for them ourselves. And I believe that the internships provided do not offer any amount of stipend.

Fee Structure And Facilities : The fee is different for different modes of admission. The KCET students pay the least while the management students end up paying the most. But I would like to say that the fee structure is pretty genuine for the KCET and COMEDK students. But I think it's way too much for management students, adding to the fact that we can't apply for any scholarships in the college.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : Since I'm a management student, apparently no scholarships are applicable to me which quite doesn't make any sense to me. I should also have been eligible for getting scholarships due to my academic performance irrespective of my mode of admission. But there are scholarships available for the SC/ST quota of course, and a few other categories as well. I really don't think this is a fair deal but well.
Hostel Facilities : I'm a day scholar. But I've heard that the hostel infrastructure is very good as compared to other colleges in the locality whereas the food quality keeps changing from time to time. The bathrooms and rooms are pretty clean out of what my fellow hostelers have told me. Only the curfew seems to be pretty strict.

Alumni/Alumna : The alumni network of the college is pretty strong I believe. There's an alumnus meet every year where all of us can go and interact with anyone we wish to. We even have seniors who are always approachable and helpful at all times. Even the alumni have done many things for the college even after graduating out.
Admission : I personally got admission to this college by a Management quota. It requires you to pay a certain amount, usually more than the other quota fees to this college. There are many other options to get admissions into the college as well, now that it has become a deemed university. A student can get admission through PESSAT, conducted by the University itself or the famous KCET.
Faculty : I truly believe that our faculty is one of the best ones available out there. They are very knowledgeable, and helpful. But again, I feel like due to the entire curriculum's planning, no faculty is completely able to do the work in the best way possible. But overall good faculty available to teach and approach at all times.",2,0,7.2,79.36,15.42908799,2,0
PES University,"Remarks : It's a great college, good potential but realising the potential needs some serious consideration from management. My point is that when I was in the college I never found placement efforts enough from the colleges end though I cannot comment on the current situation.
Course Curriculum Overview : The course curriculum during our time was under Vtu University belgaum, but now since it's a university deemed, it has its own curriculum. I feel now the curriculum has become way better as impirtance is being given to industry orientation rather than marks.
Placement Experience : The placements for mechanical stream is bleak, I mean even if good companies like lnt comes, they provide very less package. I believe even now mechanical placements are not great. But cs placements are amazing and they get hefty packages.

College Events : Maya fest is where we used to have a boom with various activities, functions, dances and what not. Bands are invited to perform and all the students and faculties enjoy cumulatively giving and amazing opportunity to gel up.
Fee Structure And Facilities : Fee structure is expensive I would say, I mean it's around 60 k per semester but then all other colleges have the same structure in bangalore, but if you are a resident of Karnataka and come through state cet exam, fees are very less. For outsiders it's high.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : I don't know but I do know that for every semesters distinction we used to get a cheque of 500 ruppes, aprat from that I believe minority scholarships are availed by many but since I was an outsider and of general category, I never had any chance to get any scholarship
Campus Life : Labs are good I would say, for every subject every sem, labs are taken seriously and you have to earn your marks in labs, nothing is for free. Sports facilities are available, the college boasts of having the best ground for cricket, football separately, badminton court etc.
Hostel Facilities : Hostel infrastructure is good, I mean above average than most of colleges in Bangalore but the problem is for boys they keep 3 students in one room, so less space but good interiors. For girls they have rented a building or two near college and they are transported to and from the college there through colleges buses. Security factor I would say is good enough.

Alumni/Alumna : Yes I mean alumnis though I don't know if there is a network but whenever someone is approached in LinkedIn, a response is sure to come, rest kindly confirm the same as I am out of touch kind of. The seniors are definitely helpful.
Admission : By comedk, the process is similar to all other colleges in Bangalore but now I believe the college also conducts it's own entrance but still has a percent of selection through comedk. (Please verify)
Faculty : Faculties are good to average with ofcourse exceptional teachers as well, mechanical during my time was anewly opened course and we had some shortage of faculties but mostly we got all amazing faculties to be dead honest.",9,13,7.2,76.21,17.79894798,-4,0
PES University,"Remarks : For a student to study well and have a good life later on this is the best college. For the people who just wanna have fun and enjoy the college this is the worst selection. We get the best placements here in this college
Course Curriculum Overview : Talking about the course and education in this college it's one of the best in the state. We had a lot of talented teachers and no excuses on studies is given by the college. If you're good at studies and do your work properly then it's easy to go through the four years of engg but for the people to enjoy other than studies this will be hell of a college for those
Placement Experience : Best college for placements. We have a record of having 100% placements in past few years and it's been continuing even now. All of us unless we are eligible we get tons of opportunities to participate in placements and acquire a job.

College Events : No inter-collegiate fest like in other college. We had a intra-college fest yearly once which is the most boring days. None of the students other than participants are present. All would sit back at home for getting a holiday on that day from class
Fee Structure And Facilities : Feasible for me as I was a merit kind offf student but for people coming through management its way too costly compared to other colleges but for the quality of education that they have and the placement and all its a good fee too
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : No scholarship is given by the college as such but I had got the scholarship from state government which was given to us without any extra fee as in other colleges. College loan is provided by the bank that is inside our campus itself and all processes are nicely taken care by the staff
Campus Life : Labs are very good with all the required and advanced components and computers. Enough number of systems are present sooo that v were not required to share the system or any of such kind. Sports is of least interest in our college. We get to participate in the tournament's but only if v have enough attendence
Alumni/Alumna : Yeah they're very helpful even though most of them are at top universities or companies and busy with their works they responded to us very nicely and were very helpful in that matter. They helped us in every possible way so that we had a easy ways of living
Admission : I wrote the Karnataka CET entrance exam and got a good rank from which I was able to join this college. The admission process pretty easy n simple all the documents that were required were all ready with me so it was easy for me to go through this process. If all the documents all present without any fail then one shouldn't have to face any problem
Faculty : They're all very talented and very much interested in teaching. No wasting of time what so ever. No free marks given. If v study n score v get marks as said v earn marks n not got marks this way they're keeping the students to have a regular studying habit and not study only during exams",5,4,8.3,78.66,18.86196372,1,0
PES University,"Remarks : If you want a good Placements College then only come to this college.We dont have much extracurricular activities, labs, sports, etc. Our college mostly is good in academics. If you are good in extracurricular activities, labs, sports, etc then you have to find your own path here.
Course Curriculum Overview : We have VTU course curriculum. It is little old fashioned and tough to study but it has a great name outside. In VTU you dont get to see your Answer sheets, so thats a little disadvantage for students.
Internships Opportunities : No,It does not provide internship. As Internship is made compulsary, we only hav to find one after seventh semester. We will have two months break for that. We really dont get more than 15 days holidays after semester exams except seventh.

Placement Experience : Placements are pretty nice in our college.As our college is in Bangalore, all the top companies come for placement in our college. Tier 1 jobs will range from 10 lakhs. So you dont have to worry about placememts in this college.
College Events : Not a lot of events happen in our college. Events celebrated in our college are: 1. MAAYA - A cultural fest happened in our college. Not at all good to attend. 2. INGENIUS- technical event, must to attend. 3. KLUDGE-technical event, must to attend. 4.TEDX- great event, must to attend.
Fee Structure And Facilities : Fee structure is pretty expensive. Its two lakhs per year for academics and one lakh for hostel and other expenses.If you are not from Karnataka you will not any good scholarship / loan facility. So you have to handle the expense on your own.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : Good scholarship / loan facility will be offered only to Karnataka state students depending on their quota. If you are not from Karnataka you will not any good scholarship / loan facility. So you have to handle the expense on your own.
Campus Life : We dont have much extracurricular activities, labs, sports, etc. Our college mostly is good in academics. If you are good in extracurricular activities, labs, sports, etc then you have to find your own path here.
Hostel Facilities : Its really good for girls and boys both. Girls hostel is outside college about 7 kms from college. So everyday you have to travel so far and ttraffic is another big problem in bangalore. Even outside timings are also early.

Alumni/Alumna : Yes, Sometimes they are helpful in providing knowledge about our future and present studies. They will help you in building your resume and taking part in different sports, technical , and creative clubs.
Exam Structure : We have one Semester exam and three internal tests per semester. Internals are of 20 marks and semester of 80 marks. Internals also contain 2 marks for attendance and 3 marks for assignments in this college.
Admission : I had wriiten COMED-K exam for colleges in karnataka. It was a computer based test including physics, chemistry and maths questions. It will be of 2 hours containing multiple choice questions. Then according to the Ranks you can decide on your college and stream.
Faculty : Faculties are pretty good in teaching. Teachers put their heart and soul in teaching the students not like other colleges in which student has to work on their own.They also teach about the current technologies.",8,3,7.5,91.5,13.86168956,5,0
PES University,"Remarks : It is best college for placements and if you are willing to do higher studies there are many faculties that would help in the way to achieve that dream. Most of the faculties want the student to do higher studies so it's not an issue
Course Curriculum Overview : I am currently pursuing my BE degree in electronics and communication branch. As I had many reviews from my seniors that this college is strict n that too EC dept is very much in that strictness but after I am that branch for past 3 n half years I feel they aren't strict they're doing work assigned with complete dedication. Exams are conducted very well nobody is allowed to copy or cheat as I have heard from many other colleges from my friends
Placement Experience : College did not provide any Internship we were asked search for it on our own just to learn how to communicate with the officials. Placements are the best part of our college. We have 100% placement from past few years. Everybody who has the eligibility will get placed . But getting a core company is hard that is there are less company's that offer core job

College Events : We have many technical events competition taking place in a very regular intervals of time like every month we have one technical event . Coming to events for entertainment we don't have big fest like other colleges it's okay okay
Fee Structure And Facilities : Fee structure is feasible for merit seats n entrance exam seats. Management quota seats are very costlier. For a free seat its like 60k per year n there is comed-k which will cost 1.4lakhs per annum n the management seat costs 4-5lakhs per annum
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : No scholarship from college as such but we get scholarship from government given based on reservation. Like for SC and ST caste govt provide full college fee only for CET seats and management people get a small amount as scholarship from government
Campus Life : Extracurricular activities are very rare they don't seem to be sooo attractive. Labs are the best in class with best equipment components n good lab attendees they have a very good knowledge of the stuffs require for us
Alumni/Alumna : Yeah they are very helpful. Even though they are working in very big companies n and very busy with their work they help us in many ways . I have contact with many of my seniors and they're very humble n interactive to answer our queries
Faculty : All the faculties are very well educated. Best faculty to the tough branch. They do their work very well they dont just pass time we don't get anything for free from them we hard work we get like marks and attendence. They treat all the students same they don't particularly focus on intelligent students equal concern is shown in everyone",7,9,8,75.26,17.5044812,-2,0
PES University,"Remarks : College management is very disorganized. Everything is done on pen and paper. For example, students have to stand in long queues for paying fees. All the decisions are made last minute and students are troubled for the simple task which can be done by the management easily, especially mechanical stream. They are too much strict with 85 per cent attendance.
Entrance Preview : It was a brain fade to be honest. I got confused about the difference between PesU & Pes. Pes was a brand at that time. The reputation that Pes holds in Bangalore and the quality of education it provides attracted many students like me. Pes has one of the best placements all across Bangalore.
Course Curriculum Overview : PESIT being affiliated to VTU has an outdated syllabus. There are few electives in higher semesters which makes completes a student in this competitive world. It does not only include core mechanical but few management subjects as well to make a student industry ready.

Internships Opportunities : As AICTE has made internship compulsory during the engineering period, the college helps the student to get the internship through references.
Placement Experience : The college has one of the best placements compared to other colleges in Bangalore. The kind of opportunities college provides for placement is quite commendable. CS, IS as well as ECE department students usually get placed very easily as n number of companies keep coming for IT stream being a college in the garden city. Mechanical student finds it hard to get placed as there is few core companies visit for recruitment.
College Events : Maaya is the annual intercollegiate technical and cultural fest at PES University – Electronic City Campus. It involves all the event wherein an individual can fit himself from gaming, quiz, dance, singing, Hackathon, debate, workshops and what not. Another event which is a home event is Activity day.
Fee Structure And Facilities : The fee structure is somewhat feasible. For Comedk tuition fees is around 1.5 lac excluding. College also incorporates other fees like stationary fees, exam fees which is common for everyone. For CET students fee structure is very feasible. They are charged around 70k for a year.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : I have availed one scholarship every year. The college has a very organized process to avail the scholarship. It also provides loan facility.
Campus Life : Campus life is very good. It has various clubs for autonomous cars, UAVs.It has various sports teams as well, they get to represent the college at bigger stages. Labs are nicely equipped and well maintained. Overall infrastructure is nice. The classrooms are well spaced and fitted with cameras to record the lectures.
Hostel Facilities : I stayed in a Pg near college as the hostel fees were very expensive. The college has a boys hostel within the campus and a girls hostel a few kilometres away from the college. The hostel within the college does not have enough rooms to accommodate all the boys so they newly built another boys hostel near girls hostel. Various facilities like 3 times food and snacks are provided, attached bathroom with geyser are given. Food is average.

Alumni/Alumna : There is no alumni network as such. But I have one instance wherein alumni had helped me. Seniors are helpful.
Exam Structure : VTU conducts semester exams during December-January & June-July. All theory exams happen for 80 marks and the other 20 marks are awarded from an internal test conducted by the college. There are three internal tests for each subject of maximum 40 marks, the AVG of two highest is taken out of 20.
Admission : I applied for Comed-k exam, got a suitable rank that secured me a seat in this college. Comedk is an entrance exam conducted to get admission in private colleges across a Karnataka.Its a 3 hour exam with 1 hour each for PCM.It consists of total of 180 questions with 60 in each subject.
Faculty : I would rate them just above par. Some of them care about the student's overall growth. They try to make the class more interactive by giving various real-life examples depending on the subject. Teachers not only focus on teaching what is there in academics but also help students with extracurricular activities like projects and research.",8,4,6.8,80.95,16.61278905,4,0
PES University,"Remarks : No. Till now nothing bad remarks of my college. As I am under VTU attendance of 75% is mandatory

Course Curriculum Overview : As I am doing electronics and communication engineering. Since I am now in first year everyone have the common portions. Still i have not entered into the branch. In first year, the batches are divided into Physics and chemistry cycle. Here they give the students idea about all the branches.
Internships Opportunities : Yes. They provide the internship. Recently the automobile industry Mercedes Benz company had come to the college for providing internship only to the girls.

Placement Experience : yes our college gives good placements and job opportunities. As our college is very reputed and known to everyone so there are many chances for placements and job opportunities. And yeah job interviews are held from 6th or 7th semester itself. We get to know how interviews actually are. They prepare us in that way.
College Events : There are many events held at our college. There is fest called Maaya where all the students participate and explore their talents. It will be of two days. The second day night will be a DJ night. Recently last month we had activity day held at our college. The whole college will be decorated.

Alumni/Alumna : Currently my brother is studying in 2 year in the same college. So i don't have any alumni network here. But our college gives good job placements.
Exam Structure : Exam structure is good in our college. We have total of three internals out of which best of two are considered. They finish the portions as per the time table. Labs are done properly and they explain each and very experiments in a understandably manner. We even have lab internals.
Admission : As I have got through CET we need to submit all the details like the order ticket, 10th marks card,12th marks card,study certificate,etc that have been submitted to the KEA. This all documents should be attested.it is not a long procedure. It is easy if you have all your document's ready.
Faculty : Faculty are good. All the teachers are good in explaining the concepts. If any student have any problem in the concept they can go to the respective teachers anytime. They explain each and every concept in an understandable way. They do it using slides of variety type to understand the concept.",2,1,9.2,85.63,13.54364407,1,0
RVCE,"Course Curriculum Overview : My course is IEM and it's not at all a sub-branch of Mechanical. It was when it is called IPE but now it has its own value. The course is comparatively easy and chill wrt other branches. The faculty is also very qualified and chill. Every class got 3 councillors i.e. 20 students per teacher.
Placement Experience : 7th sem students are eligible for campus placement. Placements are better than lots of NITs and almost all the government colleges. Average placement is >14 LPA this year for the ISC department and >8 LPA for IEM Deloitte, Capgemini, Mercedes Benz, Microsoft, Volvo etc. are some companies visit our college. No. Of offers are maximum >250 for ECE department. The highest Package is nearly 88 LPA this year Almost all the students are placed in IEM. I may prefer MBA as I'm already studying management at IEM.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : The average placement is 8.04 LPA and almost all the students get placed. Idk about the scholarship because I didn't get one. The fee structure is the same for all branches i.e. 2.4 LPA approx. There is a schola department in the administrative block I guess soo the rest of the inquiry they'll only give you.
Campus Life : The campus is small, with not too much space to roam around but still campus life is good. Annual fest is 8th mile but it won't happen annually, Esummit happens almost after every year which is also a good fest. Fests are conducted after every 2-3 months, small or big doesn't matter. Enough books are available in the library to make use of it. The classroom contains a smart board and is good for a student kind of environment. The sports culture is pretty good as uk Anil Kumble and lots of other sports personalities are from RVCE. Ecell, RAAG, Rotaract, coding club, Alap etc. are some of the clubs.
Admission : Admission is through the COMEDK entrance exam. The eligibility criteria are 12th percentage is more than 70. The application form is available on comedk official website. Top college's CSE cutoff is under 1000-2000 rank",7,6,8,89.64,15.65979217,1,0
RVCE,"Course Curriculum Overview : I chose this course as the placements in the college are very good. the faculty to student ratio is around one teacher per 60 students. Maximum teachers are PhD and they are very qualified. Internals are very regular, they happen every month and the term exams are 1 per 6 months.

Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : The Comedk fees per year are Rs 201960. The fees are around 4 times the KCET fees. They also take admission through management quota. I am currently a college student and I am yet to get an internship or job. And I didn't avail of any Scholarship or financial assistance.
Campus Life : Due to covid-19, no college fests have been organised yet. only e-summit occurred in 2022 organised by our college's E-Cell. The library is stocked with hard copies and soft copies of information. The classrooms have blackboards and whiteboards along with projectors.
Hostel Facilities : The wifi quality is very bad in our college. You won't get wifi accessibility all over our college. The mess food is South India oriented. It's a pure veg hostel mess. The hostel fees get changed every year. The college and the boy's hostel are present on the same campus.
Admission : I was admitted to the college via Comedk Exams. You can find the application form on their official website. The admission process during our admission time was very tedious and lengthy. So you have to be very patient.",6,1,5.7,92.55,14.51943755,5,0
RVCE,"Course Curriculum Overview : I choose this course because I am very much interested in the electrical domain so I would get into core companies like bosch and Goldman Sachs. The faculty here are very highly qualified that is they have completed their Ph.D. in their respective domains. the faculty: student ratio is 1:25. Exams here are very difficult and should study around the year to get good grades,
Internships Opportunities : google and Microsoft provide internships if we get through their exams and competitions. Industry-certified internships for 4th sem students are provided. we a team of 10 are undergoing a project titled mobile app development using android. we were funded by an amount of rs 45000 for that.
Placement Experience : After third-year students are eligible for placements and many companies come to RV college as it is the top private college in Bangalore. Many companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Accenture, goldman sachs come to my college. more than 98% percent of students are placed in my college. i would most likely opt for higher studies after the degree that is completing my master's in the USA.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : the fees are constant throughout the 4 years 350000 per year and the cost of the study is high as the college is situated in Bangalore. Financial assistance is given by the college as there are schemes to get scholarships.
Campus Life : Extravaganza concrete fair is the name of the fest which is conducted every year and hackathons are also conducted every year. We have a dedicated central library that contains journals, e-books, reference books, etc. The classrooms here are soo good with good furniture and projectors in every classroom. We have very big grounds for respective sports and there are many tournaments and events conducted every year.
Admission : 60% is needed in 10th and 12th to get into rvce. the application form is found on the official website of rvce college and the application fee is 650rs application dates can be seen on the official website as well which is www.rvce.edu.in. The admission process is pretty much late, if it would be made faster it would be soo good.",5,9,8.8,76.25,18.2973399,-4,0
RVCE,"Remarks : I got admission to RVCE through the Karnataka common entrance test (KCET). I had a rank of 225 and during counseling, I opted for Aerospace engineering in RV. After the counseling results are announced, one has to accept (or reject and go to the next round) the seat and pay the government fees to the given bank account number. After that, one must visit the college with 4 copies of all the mentioned documents and might need to carry a DD of the specified amount. The cut-off varies according to the branch and categories. The aerospace department has a mediocre cut-off for CET.
Course Curriculum Overview : I chose this course because I am passionate about it. The faculty-student ratio is quite good (66:6) as every course has different faculties. There are also a few visiting professors and inter-departmental course-handling professors. The faculties are well qualified and the teaching method is neat with a proper balance of theory classes, lab (practicals), and Experiential learning projects. There will be internals almost every month and the tests are quite interesting with application-level and theory-level questions. If one invests a good amount of time in academics, it'll be easy to score.
Internships Opportunities : The college provides a 2-3 month window for internships after the 3rd year and many companies visit to take interviews and provide internships. For example, Boeing hires interns from the aerospace and the mechanical department with a stipend of 30000 per month. There are also many unpaid internship opportunities available for students from the 3rd semester itself.
Placement Experience : Students become eligible for campus placements from the 3rd year. In the aerospace department, companies like Boeing and Airbus visit, and an average of 9-10 LPA offers are made. The highest offer in the Aerospace department according to my knowledge is 14LPA. Almost every student gets placed in RV, but students in the Aerospace branch mostly opt for higher studies. I too plan on doing higher studies in a good college after BE.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : The fees remain almost constant throughout the 4 years of engineering. The hike or drop in fees is almost insignificant. There are no particular scholarships awarded by the college as such (at least to my knowledge ), but the college does support and provide the required documents for applying for scholarships elsewhere. Campus jobs are not something the college provides, at least to BE students.
Campus Life : The most annual fest is 8th Mile which happens around June. The best tech fest is conducted by the Aerospace department in association with AeSI called ""Aeromania"" which is a 3-day aero-technical fest in which students from colleges throughout Bangalore participate. The library is very huge and one can find almost any book needed easily with the smart search system. Classrooms are spacious with many benches, projectors, lighting, and fans. The encouragement of sports and extracurricular activities meets every student's expectations. Cricket, volleyball, baseball, basketball, badminton, tennis, archery, etc. Many cultural clubs (Rotaract, Raag, Aalap, footprints, etc) and technical clubs (Antariksh, Ashwa, Jatayu, Vyoma, Helios, etc) are always active.",10,2,7.8,76.46,19.09167918,8,0
RVCE,"Remarks : the admission process was very systematic, it took one Full day to complete. Eligibility of the Course: admission usually takes through KCET, COMDEK, AND MANAGEMENT QUOTA. I joined through kcet with the rank of 26k surprising right, yeah I know. I got through the rural quota. Where to find the application form, application fees, and application dates: usually, you find the application form on the KEA website and the application fee is given below General merit, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B - Rs.500/- SC, ST, CAT-1 - Rs.250/- Female candidates of Karnataka- Rs.250/- Candidates outside Karnataka - Rs.750/- application dates usually vary and are informed by KEA Reservation Benefits: I got through the rural quota with the rank of 26292 in the second round usually, the cutoff rank for general merit is around 6k it would be better if most of the process is done online before visiting the college during admission
Course Curriculum Overview : the course curriculum & faculty members are good I choose this course because I wanted electronics and with my rank, this was only the course I was getting and wanted to change brank to EC but now I understood this was the best branch if you want free time and electronics and the syllabus is almost the same compared to EC faculty: student ratio is 3:32 which is fine in Karnataka Qualification of the faculty is top notch because most of them are PhD from top IIT and their teaching method is very old school like every Indian college because everything is studied by us and not by the teacher there are 3 internals and they take the best of two and each term is completed within 4 months and talking about the difficulty level it is easy to pass but it's difficult to score above 9 cgpa and very very difficult to change branch if you thinking about branch change please don't try RVCE
Internships Opportunities : College does provide internships which are of no use but if you want the real value of an internship try cold email to the company in and around as Bangalore is full of opportunity and do try angel list if you really want a stipend for more info go to angelist.com

Campus Life : the campus is the best in Banglore but not as good as top-tier college if you are interested in Social Life and Clubs, Bangalore is best but uses it good purpose or it may waste your time and time is money, my friend RVCE conducts the best fest in Bangalore called '8th mile' once in 2 years but they haven't conducted it in the last 3 years RVCE Ecell hosts E SUMMIT which is another biggest fest that they conduct every year there is a huge collection of books & journals in the library but nobody reads it all classrooms are well-ventilated, not air-conditioned, and neat the wifi depends on each branch and is very good in EIE there is a huge opportunity for those who are interested in sports & extra-curricular activities but unfortunately, there's only one ground left to play as all grounds are taken in the name of construction there are numerous social groups, and clubs run by students the best are ecell, ashwa racing, quiz corp, and block learning. please do join the club in the 1st yr
Hostel Facilities : the hostel provides good wifi and a good roommate if your lucky although the hostel facilities are not the best trust me its the best part of your college life you enjoy a lot more than college life, if you don't agree see youtube the food in the mess is OKAY and can be adjusted by people in Karnataka but for north India it's pathetic and don't miss the fest as its best and you'll get once a month the Registration Process is very simple but please book the hostel in advance as there are only limited seats the fees are not affordable as it 117000 and increase every year if you are not opting hostel then try renting a flat in BDA which costs less than a hostel and if you're renting with 5 or more friends",4,5,7,8.75,43.12552995,-1,0

In order to get into cse branch of the college by management quota the fees go up to 60 lakhs per year.
Course Curriculum Overview : My course is electronics and instrumentation. I chose this course because I always had an interest in electronics, my rank fetched me this branch and I really have no regrets. The course curriculum includes mainly core electronics, a few subjects of core instrumentation, few information technology-related subjects. Moreover, the college also focuses on developing the soft skills of a student. The faculty members are highly qualified with each one of them holding a Ph.D. degree from a reputed institution. The teaching methods are amazing and they are always ready to help. S semester three internal exams(this comprises of a 50 marks written test and 10 marks quiz) are conducted out of which the best of two is considered for final marks and one semester-end exam of 100 marks is conducted. It is not at all difficult to pass the examinations. In fact, with a little sincere afford and hard work, one can get a very good cgpa.

RVCE,"Remarks : The admission process was quite easy. Eligibility depends on your KCET or ComedK ranks. The application form is available on their site. Not availed reservation. They can take fewer exams and give students some more time for self-evaluation
Course Curriculum Overview : The curriculum is moderate to hard. The faculty-student ratio is good. Almost every professor is a PhD. Exams are taken the time and there are 3 internals and one final exam. It's not that difficult to pass the exam
Internships Opportunities : Internship opportunities are also nice but depend on u totally how much u work hard for them. Almost similar companies come for placements and internships. Many companies depending on ur work provide Pre-placement offers (PPO) to many students
Placement Experience : The placements at the college are very great. Every year big companies come to go to the college like Google, Qualcomm, Accenture, Goldman Sachs etc. And they have opportunities to almost every branch and the placement committee is also very helpful

RVCE,"Remarks : I had written both CET and COMEDK for getting into Karnataka engineering colleges, CET is specifically for Karnataka students whose domicile is here for at least 7 years. Comedk can be written by anyone, the cut-off for Chemical engineering was 8000 ( including extended rounds) the cutoff for Comedk was 15000 for the 2nd round.
Course Curriculum Overview : The term exams are known as SEE or semester-end exams, the papers were fairly moderate but electrical was insanely hard for all students combined. The semester was rushed to the next level to finish portions without giving gaps between internals because of covid, they finished the semester in 3 months.
Internships Opportunities : The internships provided are actually good. The department makes sure you are provided opportunities someplace or the other to gain experience in your work field to be better prepared for the corporate world in Chemical engineering.
Placement Experience : Supposedly the best placements in Karnataka after IIIT and NITK, but looking at the placements, they seem like peanuts, taking a job after B.E for chemical engineering at least is an absolute waste since the average package is 7-8 lakh p.a and the highest is 14-16 lakh p.a. Percentage for chem is less since most students do Masters or M.Tech after Chemical engineering. But yes it's the best u can get in Karnataka. The companies that come are actually good. The number too.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : There are three tiers of payment, CET general merit students pay up to 80000, and other reservation students get discounts depending upon their caste, category, etc. Comedk general merit was 222000. Also, there is a management quota, which is a payment seat to put it straight.
Campus Life : Secondary importance is given to co-curriculars and extracurricular activities, funds are not enough at all to improve sports facilities, and they're barely even existent. The clubs are present and enthusiastic but support is barely present from the administration.
Hostel Facilities : The process to get in was pretty smooth, the quality of food was maintained in the beginning two months but deteriorated later. The menu is extremely repeatitive and most days you eat to survive and not because you want to eat. The rooms are actually good. Girls hostel is 3 sharing . But the wardens and administration are next level mysoginistic and so much inequality wrt curfews, etc compared to boys.",10,12,6.2,67.31,19.14935349,-2,0
RVCE,"Remarks : I have joined information science and engineering at RV College of Engineering. u can get admission through kcet or comedk.

RVCE has a good environment for sports. sports teams have won many awards as I am not into sports I can say u can check all the achievements on the official website of RVCE. There are so many clubs in RVCE you will find a club for almost everything there is a coding club there is NSS, NCC,Oshawa racing club there are many u can check on the official website.
Hostel Facilities : In hostel rooms for one room, there are 2 ppl and in your final year, u will get a single room for yourself u will be provided with a wifi facility.

Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : Fee structure is surely a disadvantage in this college but I would suggest that you can take this risk because the opt-out or placement opportunities are pretty good at RVCE. The college even helps eligible candidates with some fee concessions or Merit Scholarships. The total fee for the B.E-CSE program was INR 24 Lakhs, divided into annual shifts for the students
Campus Life : RVCE's campus is spreaded over 51 acres while the campus life of the college is filled with a lot of Events and Facilities. Our library included over 1.4 Lac books and various magazines & journals were also available there.

Food court, Banking and internet facilities are also provided in our college.
Hostel Facilities : Hostel services are available in the college at a large scale which is why 4 boy's & 3 girls hostels are provided by the institute. The annual charges for the facility was around INR 30,000 . Both mess and accommodation services in the college are good with all the basic needs being fulfilled by RVCE. If you want to get additional facilities in your room or the mess cuisine then you must pay some extra charges for them. However, I haven't lived in the college hostel during my Graduation.",10,14,9,73.4,18.68034188,-4,0
MSRIT,"Course Curriculum Overview : Mechanical is a well-known branch in Ramaiah and also it has good placement which is the reason I joined this branch. Ramaiah has good strength of faculty.

I would like to suggest the management of COMEDK as well as Ramaiah Institute get their counseling session done on my time and not postpone the dates.
Course Curriculum Overview : I chose the course (Information science and engineering) because it is an IT-based course and we all know that jobs in the IT sector in our country are booming. The faculty-student ratio is very convincing 6 faculties per 100 students. 70% of the facilities have completed their doctorate in their respective domain. Therefore, most of the teachers are Ph.D. as well as having numerous research papers written by them. The teaching method used by the faculties is up to the mark since the teachers are highly qualified that is they have a thorough knowledge of their subject hence they are good at teaching as well. There are three main exams two internals and one semester and exam the two internals are worth 30 marks each and while compilation of marks average of these two test marks is taken along with the 20 mark project component is there and finally, a 100 marks semester and exam which is half halved to 50, therefore, compiling to 100 marks.

MSRIT,"Remarks : I am a student of RIT and in 6th sem right now and till now with my experience, I can tell that this college is very good for UG education and provides many opportunities to us to do projects and stuff. Teaching completely depends on students' understanding and we also have fests and other co-curricular activities going on in our college. When it comes to exams they are conducted in an organised way. I don't know much about placements but there is always some of the other good companies who come for recruitments. The campus atmosphere is also good. In RIT, we have two major library complexes where you can find textbooks and reference books to prepare for exams and for research purposes also. We also have an auditorium and 3-4 seminar halls all over the college where we can host any activity or show related to the college clubs.

Course Curriculum Overview : I'm from the medical electronics engineering program provided by RIT and this branch is not very highly rated in our college as most of the focus will be on CS, IS, EC etc. When it comes to faculty: student ratio, for every class there are 60 students and the whole department has around 10 teachers sometimes it gets difficult to clear doubts as there are many students surrounding a teacher. Most of the faculty are PhD graduates and knowledgeable.

Campus Life : We have 2 major fests kannada rajyotsava and udbhav. Kannada rajyotsava is a cultural fest which happens in the month of November and udbhav is the major fest which happens generally in the month of march but due to covid it didn't happen since 3 years.

We have well qualified faculties and they teach really well except for a few. Our term exams were conducted on time and it was moderately difficult.

Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : Our college fees are 230000 through comedk. And it is 89000 through Kcet. Management fees are around 700000 for Chemical engineering and it varies with the branch you choose. I don't receive any scholarships from the college.

Hostel Facilities : There are good quality rooms available. There are gym facilities and wifi facilities also. Food quality is not that good and needs improvement and the menu is not that good. Hostels are actually very costly and are not worth the cost.",10,9,6.6,83.69,15.51571551,1,0
MSRIT,"Remarks : I got admission via the COMEDK exam. ComedK application forms are available on Comedk website. Application fees were around 1400 because I applied for Comedk and UGET. My rank was around 4K without any reservations. I had many choices but I chose chemical engineering as I was interested in it. I opted for RVCE, RIT, and BMS. The counseling was hassle free and simple. I got my admission in RIT and they asked for documents like birth certificate, 10th class marks, 12th marks, bonafide and TC, Comedk rank card, and the fee receipt of 50000 which we pay during the counseling. The remaining prescribed fees have to be paid by the college admission counselor.
Course Curriculum Overview : I am personally interested in Chemical engineering, so I chose the course, and the faculty students ratio is kind of okayish approximately 1:5. All of my faculty have Ph.D. or are either pursuing Ph.D. There are many projects where u can assist the teachers, giving you more exposure to teachers, labs. The teaching method is good they stick to the curriculum and try to provide extra information as and when required. Exams happen roughly let's say every 1.5 months. 2 Internal tests and the final Sem end exam. Passing the subjects was never an issue but acing the exam (getting 85% +) is kind of difficult.
Class Size : 50
Course Fees : INR 220000 per year
Internships Opportunities : Internships are offered by companies like Cipla and thermax. They are decent enough, but most of them don't pay you a stipend. Being an industrial subject, where experience is an important consideration, these Internships are kinda decent. Freshers in chemical engineering have to work really hard to get into the industry no matter where they study.
Placement Experience : From the 6th semester, students are eligible for campus placements. Companies like Asian Paint visit the campus. But the core company placement isn't that great. Pandemic changed everything. Teachers and HOD here have a lot of connections, so they will help you to get placed off-campus. Well, you can get an IT job in mass recruitment with an average package of 4-5LPA. I personally want to do research, so I am working in that direction,i.e. I am planning for my higher studies.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : Even though the fee is 220000, it's worth every penny because of the lab facilities and the college environment. There is a fee hike now, I am not sure how much. But I felt they could have done some fee relaxations during a pandemic.
Campus Life : Social Life at the campus is the best. You have a lot of exposure. There are students coming from all over India with varied backgrounds. There are many cultural and technical clubs. I personally enjoyed being a part of NSS. The sports facilities are decent and there are fests which make your college life fun. Udbhav happens in even sem which is probably one of the famous fests in the entire Bengaluru city. KR happens in odd semesters. Amenities in classrooms, libraries, washrooms, labs are top class.",6,3,7.8,81.21,16.15079142,3,0
MSRIT,"Remarks : College is good, faculty teaching is good with experienced ones. Coming to college infrastructure, the library is so good, labs were aslo good. Coming to placements side...for chemical engineering there are no good placements....its all the gate score which u need to focus on. So dont get core jobs offers in chemical engineering of this college...Focus on gate exam.
Course Curriculum Overview : Basically I choosed chemical engineering because I have Intrest in oil refineries and working there. So writing gate exam and getting good score leads me to qualify such companies interviews. We have 2 internals and 1 semester end exam. Aslo faculty is good according to experience not through qualifications
Class Size : 55
Course Fees : INR 217360 per year
Placement Experience : From 6th semester we will become eligible for campus placements. Very few companies will visit for chemical engineering those are aslo not core. Highest package offered for a chemical engineering is 600000 I guess this aslo a long back. But dont take a hope on placements here in chemical weapons. Do mainly focus on Gate exam. Get good score go for mtech or apply for good core jobs for interview.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : Basically fees in our college increases every batch wise (4 years). My fees was 217360. We need to pay whole amount at at time, which is bit difficult for everyone. It would have been better if it is been like 3 or 4 installments. Scholarship is totally for Karnataka students. There will be no scholarship for other state students ,what I know may be we have but I've never seen that for other state people. As I from Andhrapradesh.
Campus Life : Annual fests and tech fest are pretty well conducted. Now due to covid, those been not conducted. Udbhav is one which I heard when, at the time of joining my college. But till now I dint seen once aslo conducting Udbhav event. Availability of book are pretty good in our library. Sports and extra circular activities will go on every year.
Hostel Facilities : My hostel room has 2 chairs, one fan, 2 shelfs, 2 lockers, 2 beds , 2 tables. Share of 2 people per room. Meal quality is bad for me. I dint like the food there at all. I'm eating the same food from 3 years till now. Salt will be soo less in foods. For 10 I'll give 4 for food there. No non veg at all. If u want the college hostel, then at the time of joining once u should meet the hostel warden there and talk to them . We need to make a DD of that amount and pay for getting room there.",7,6,6.6,91.73,12.94771589,1,0

Placement Experience : placements are good here, the average package is of 8lpa and that of cs branches are approx 13-14lpa. The highest package apple made this year is 62lpa which is quite amazing. for civil you will find foreign placements more. all top companies visit here. Google also came to campus once with a 1.5cr package but none of the students made it to the final round which is mainly bcoz of 85% compulsory attendance and a regular 6 to 7 classes which makes the schedule hectic.

The application form and all other details were found in the college admission block. If had any reservations you may get this college, but kcet rank is important. The admission process is good in our college. If you want a good college in Karnataka, then you choose MSRIT(Ramaiah Institute of Technology).
Course Curriculum Overview : I like the mechanical branch, so I choose Mechanical Engineering. The faculties are very nice. Their teaching method is good. Almost all faculty completed PhD. One term is around 4 to 5 months. Exams are neither difficult nor easy. It's all how much you study. One good thing is this college is an autonomous institute, affiliated with vtu. There is a proctorial system in college. It really helps students.
Class Size : 60
Course Fees : INR 86000 per year
Internships Opportunities : The college provides internships for students. Companies like Boeing, Toyota, Kirloskar and other companies give internships to students. If you are a CS, IS, EC student opportunities are more compared to core branches. I'm second year student. So I don't know much about this.

Apple, IBM and other MNC are visited for software branches. In 2021, 521 companies visited our college. In 2021 Apple offers 64 LPA CTC to 3 CS students.

If mech and other core branches are well skilled and also have good scores then they get good jobs. I want to get a good job after my degree.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : I get a seat from kcet. So I paid 8600 in first year and 74200 in this year. Again I say the college very good. Because college it-self provide scholarship for economically weak students through alumini assosiation. I guess no other colleges will provide these facilities.

The majority of them are Ph.D. qualified and have decades of teaching experience. The faculty to student ratio in my course is around 1:50. The faculty members are very friendly, they teach the concepts well, teach us with practical exposures and take frequent quizzes and class tests. The internals happens every 45 days and they test us on our basic mechanical knowledge. It's easy to score well if one takes all the assignments and classes seriously.

IT placements are really good with top companies like Amazon, Apple, Microsoft recruiting every year. In core mechanical, companies like Larsen and Turbo, Mercedes, Boeing, etc come for placements. The placement cell of RIT is active all the time and students can seek help from their teachers and staff regarding the same. Around 80% of students who sit for placements get placed every year. The highest package in college goes to around 50 LPA and the average college package is 8 LPA. My plan in the future is to prepare for the CAT exam and get into a very good MBA college.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : For attaining a seat in my college, there are three ways. If you are a Karnataka resident then there is a special quota for students. They are required to give KCET exam and depending on their score they are required to give the fees. The other method is for non-karnataka students which are comedk exam. Fees through this are the same for all the courses. The last method is by management quota. Apart from this, special scholarship programs are also run by campus in which students who are fit to avail depending on the requirements, can get the courses for much less price.
Campus Life : Campus life is awesome if you have the right group of friends. There are many things to explore, many clubs ( both cultural and technical) to take part in, many sports to play and many fests to attend. The campus is beautiful and has all the facilities one can aspire for. Sports is really good with the facility for cricket, basketball, football, table tennis, tennis, carrom, chess, volleyball and much more. A gym is there on the college campus. Apart from this, there are many innovative clubs for students to learn more skills and to showcase their talents 3 major fests are organized every year. One is Kannada Rajyotsav which is the regional fest of Karnataka. One is Imperial which happens in February. It is a technical fest and students get to know lots of things about it. And the best one is Udbhav which happens in April. It is the best cultural fest among all VTU colleges. Many events, DJ nights and co-curricular activities, treasure hunts, shows, dramas, dances, music, etc are organized in it.
Hostel Facilities : The hostel in RIT is good. For boys, there is a separate hostel for freshers and a different one for seniors. The rooms are affordable with the mess. Services like laundry and ironing are also provided. Washrooms are clean and hygienic. A hot water facility is also there. Rooms are available for all students who want to opt for them. Almirahs, racks, tables, chairs, sockets are provided for all students. Mess is also there providing breakfast, lunch, evening snacks, and dinner every day.

The hostel life in RIT is fun and interesting.",7,2,7.3,80.19,15.83337832,5,0
MSRIT,"Remarks : The eligibility of the course is like 9k to 10k rank in kcet. The application form and all other details were found in the college admission session only. They will guide you once u come to college for admission. Reservation benefit is more because if u have bad rank then u can get into a good college on basis of reservation.if u are sc/st then you can get the seat for a rank around 55-60k. I am saying this because one of my friend got a seat based on this so I better suggest you to apply band take more benifit of reservation. Basically I would have got a seat on the general list but I don't know y they considered my reservation. There are students having rank worst than also they got the college under govt seat. I would like to add that at least first globe students seat who are eligible then they can give seats for those having bad rank.
Course Curriculum Overview : I choose mechanical because after my BTEC I wanted to go for govt services so I thought it will be the best option. I wanted to say about the faculty is best and they are well qualified from various big institutions. Most of them have done PhD. They are so kind that any time any help they are ready to help out (Personal or educational). It's been a year on campus Till now I have never seen a single faculty being rude to anyone. Their teaching method is good and I said about their qualifications and any doubt at any time we can contact them. They encourage us to do research and review the research papers. The exams are also conducted strictly. No modes of malpractice are allowed if found then strict action will be taken. Exams are conducted regularly. It's not that the exams will be too tuff. You can easily pass by reading at the last moment also.

Internships Opportunities : College allows you to take an internship at any semester and it motivates you to try to help you in all situations.

The college allows all students for any scholarships. I got a scholarship of 30 k last year under NSP so you can apply for govt scholarship and get you are compensation. The college recently doesn't have any financial assistance or job on the campus for students for which students can get paid but if we want we can do our internship outside and get paid.
Campus Life : The campus is the best I think. Over the entire campus, free wifi is available and u can enjoy the wifi for free if you are in a college hostel. And to talk about fest college regularly conduct and allows us to take fest. Recently we had Karnataka rajostova in our college we all enjoyed a lot in the fest. Our college has a big fest which will be conducted in the month of April ca UDHBAV it's the best fest In my opinion. All kinds of competitive, syllabus related, research related books are available and even digital library is available and for students, the library facilities are available till night 9 and morning it starts from 6 or 7. You can really utilise the library at the most extent. The classroom is good and it's digital as well as the board.

All kind of sports is allowed on campus even the campus contains basketball,cricket, long tennis badminton, swimming pool, etc all type of courts are available on the campus and the college support.

For registration, while admission to college u can say then that u need hostel they will give u some forms. U need to fill them that's it. It won't take much of you are time and no need to bother about the hostel you can avail easily. I never rented a room bec I got the best and good room in a hostel and all facilities are given at a low cost so I did not get out for rental.",6,4,9.7,86.21,14.57600976,2,0

Course Curriculum Overview : The technical courses from RIT are respected and revered in the country. The Civil Engineering branch is the best in this college. There are enough teachers for the doubts of every student. I didn't experience a teacher asking me to go to my own faculty for problem solving. They are well educated and qualified, and well trained. Some teachers were not as good as the others but you can always ignore those. The exams are a bit hectic here. 3 internals and one TEE. You have the option to take only 2 internals in a semester, so it's easier. Compared to this model, most colleges in North India have one internal and one end sem. The exams are not difficult at all by any standard.
Class Size : 65
Course Fees : INR 165000 per year
Internships Opportunities : There are internship opportunities and the college regularly mails you the details as they come. I received at least one email every month. Most notable were DELL and HP. I can't speak on the stipend as I was already enrolled elsewhere, but there will be enough of both paid and unpaid ones. They help tremendously in the CV building. Take as many as you want.
Placement Experience : Placements are the best thing about this college. You only need to maintain a gpa of 7 or above and the college faculty helps you prepare for the interviews. You will get placed with a good enough score card and basic interview skills. Do not worry about that at all. All kinds of companies visit the campus, from new startups to amazon, even the army. Over 3000 offers are made every year for a batch of around/over 1000 students. The college is very well respected when it comes to placements. You'll benefit with just the name in other interviews for internships and jobs.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : My tuition fees were 1.65 lac, which is lower than other engineering colleges in Bangalore. You don't really have to spend on books as all are easily available in the library. Moreover, the notes are easily available and very affordable. I didn't buy a single book during the course. There are scholarships available for underprivileged students. I can't speak much of that as I wasn't a recipient.
Campus Life : There are too many fests here haha. Literary fests, cultural fests, annual fests etc. It's a fun life if you participate in the events, and fun if you're just attending. Classrooms are fine, spacious enough. Sometimes the voice of the professor doesn't carry to the back so you may want to skip the last two rows. No AC in the classes as Bangalore has the best weather in the country. You may want to bring a hoodie from September to December. There is a sports complex.. quite newly constructed (in 2017 I believe) with quite enough facilities you'd need. All sorts of clubs and committees exist here. Join one and benefit from the attendance.",8,1,8.4,91.35,14.58175699,7,0

The fee structure for the k-cet seat is 1Lac per year and for management is approximately 3Lacs per year. The admission process should be less time-consuming as it takes a full day Or even the next day if the payment is struck other than that the admission process is very good.
Course Curriculum Overview : I decided to choose this course as I had somewhat of a curiosity about civil engineering. Exams were conducted by vtu Many companies visited BIT. Includes structured learning activities that, in a real or simulated fashion, allow students to experience problem-solving and inquiry in situations that are drawn from their personal experiences and real-world applications. Develops students' abilities to make meaningful applications and generalizations to new problems and contexts. However, the faculty care less about students whether they understood the concept or not. They just come teach and go. As of now a maximum number of faculty have been qualified in the same college and got the job of professor but the senior faculty have more than 20+ years of experience in teaching as well as industrial experience too. The college conducts three internals and they would be in a time gap of one to one and half months the semester-end exams are conducted about 6 months from the start of the course.
Class Size : 60
Course Fees : INR 85056 per year
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : The fee structure is low for those students who get admitted through K-CET. The fee for a student coming from outside the state is quite high which makes it an expensive college. Around 2 lacs per year for the students coming from another state and 1 lac per year for the students of Karnataka. And for the people getting admission through management is too costly as it costs about 3lacs per year. Hasn't opted for any loans or scholarships such as ssp and CM farmer fund and labor's scholarship provide an average scholarship of 20000 to 50000 application procedure was explained on the official website
Campus Life : Gender ratios in the college are quite good. The boy's hostel sometimes holds a party once a year. The college has a cultural club and student here are from different states of India, which make it quite diverse. There is a women's cell for tolerance regards to gender ethnicity, Race, religion, Sexual orientation, Politics, and economic status. There are 2 to 3 libraries for students to study and do research and they are open till late at night even for day scholars",9,10,7.3,71.88,19.75867261,-1,0
BIT,"Remarks : The eligibility for any course in Bangalore Institute of Technology is that one should have cleared his 12th. We can even apply to the college through KCET, COMEDK, and management. I am a student who got admission to this college through KCET. I just followed the option entry process of KCET and came through this college. Similar is the process for COMEDK. For the students opting for management quota, you have to apply through the application form, which will be available on the official website of the college and can be taken by visiting the college. I had a reservation for the 3B category under the rural category, which is availed through KEA(KCET). The admission process for the academic year of 2022-23 is already started from the month of September.
Course Curriculum Overview : I chose the Computer science and engineering course as it is the fastest-spreading engineering degree everywhere. Even the best placement records of our college are for the branch of CSE. The faculties are well aware of the course and teach pretty well. When it comes to the teaching level, some of the faculties are good whereas some just rant about things and goes forward without even caring whether we understood or not. Moreover, when it comes to engineering it all comes down to the individual teaching efforts irrespective of the teacher or the teaching method. We are given 3 internal tests in a semester, in which the time gap between two tests will be around a month or just more than that. The tests will be moderate and not that tough to pass.
Class Size : 180
Course Fees : INR 100000 per year
Internships Opportunities : Companies visit the placement cell of BIT and offer internships to students in their final year. The companies visiting include Cisco, Bosch, Walmart and so on. They offer three to six months internships for students and selected students are offered a fixed-job in the same company. You can be eligible for internships when you reach your final year or even in the sixth sem. Leaves required for students will be granted by the college, after some minor circuses. The students can also apply for internships outside the campus.
Placement Experience : The placement records of BIT are excellent. Almost all of the students get placed at the end of their graduation. The students will be available for placements after the 6th sem. The companies visited include Dell, Accenture, Amazon, Oracle, Altran, IBM, Infosys, etc and over 650 students were placed in the last academic year. The highest package offered in the last year was 29LPA, and the average package was 7.5LPA. Almost 90% or more students get placed in this college. I'm planning on getting placed after my graduation. Even students can get training for competitive exams such as GATE here if they are planning to pursue their higher education after engineering.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : For the students opting to this college through KCET and COMEDK, the fee structure is as described by the system of admission by the respective exams. On top of that, a skill lab fee of almost 20K will be levied on the students. And for management, it's as described as the college, which changes year to year, precisely it increases year after year and it also depends on the course you are choosing. The college will provide you with the details of many scholarships to which you can apply and even some exams to attend for the scholarship. These scholarships majorly deal with girl students. I got the SSP scholarship which is granted by the Karnataka government.
Campus Life : The main fest of BIT is called 'Manthan' which takes place in the month of June. It includes the appearance of star actors, some concerts and DJ night along with some crazy activities organized by the clubs of the college. When it comes to infrastructure, the college stands down as all it has is 3 buildings and two canteens and is surrounded by other institutions. As the college is situated in almost the heart of the city, we can't expect much of infrastructure. The college even organises an event for Kannada rajyotsava, called 'Kannada Kalarava' at the end of November. This will be organised by a single club named 'samskruthi' which is the Kannada club of the college. The libraries are well equipped with plenty of books which are required for the students for academic purposes. The classrooms are well equipped but are a bit old-fashioned. Almost all clubs of the college are managed by the students themselves. Sports and cultural activities are conducted during fests.",2,2,7.4,77.12,16.54349206,0,0
BIT,"Remarks : Hey, I'm Rahul, a 2nd-year B.E student at BIT of Information Science and Engineering branch. I just completed 1 year of college and the journey was quite good. And it's a 4-year course. For admission, if you do not belong to Karnataka (kcet exam) then the Comedy exam is a must, after that, you get into Comedy counseling and a good rank of 5k is required for ISE. You can opt for management cota also but the fees will be very high almost 4.5 lakh a year. The admission process is very good you will get everything info along with counseling.
Course Curriculum Overview : I choose IT as my course because of the requirements of employees of IT in Bangalore itself. The course is more about programming which I am passionate about. Now, The faculty is quite good some are Ph.D. from good universities and some are just average. you can take a ratio of 1 faculty at Every 60 students. The teaching method is not great it's like just simply explaining the concept but the labs are great. Exams are really easy and easy to crack means you get a lot of time which you can give to acquire good skills. Overall you need not worry about the exam.
Class Size : 60
Course Fees : INR 247180 per year
Internships Opportunities : College provides internships from 1year onwards. You are going to get a lot of internship opportunities from the college itself. But you are living in the IT hub of India means you will get a lot of internship offers from Bangalore also. The college has a lot of groups where you are getting information about internships available in the market and college according to your interest. For an internship, you can get a stipend of 10 to 30k based on a startup or company. So for an internship, you need not worry.
Placement Experience : If you are from CSE or ISE branch you are getting a 100 percent placement. Almost every company visits the colleges like Amazon, Adobe, Accenture, Infosys, TCS, etc. The average package is 6 LPA and the highest package of this year is 37 LPA. you can expect a min package of 3lpa if you are from ise or cse .you can apply for placement from the 3rd year onward and for the internship 2nd year onwards. I am expecting a good package afterward my degree completion from the college campus itself.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : The thing I always felt is that the fees for Comedk students are very high it's 2.5 lakh excluding Hostel and other expenses. It's very high but the college is almost in the mid of Bangalore and it's expensive so you can assume 1-1.5 lakh fora hostel or pg. Your all cost, of the course, is between 15 to 20 lakh. Now, In return, you can grasp a package as much as you want according to your programming skills. Almost every company is coming to campus for placements and giving a good package also. But if you want to enjoy this college is not for you.
Campus Life : Now it comes to campus life. The campus of the college is very small .it's just a building with some indoor games but the college is mid of Bangalore means you can explore everything outside the college. You will get good ground and everything you want within a range of 1 to 5km. students are active in sports. The college has good digital libraries so you need not buy books or any course material. In college, there are a lot of clubs about coding, culture, social, personality development, dance, singing, etc. So you can join one or many. You can get information about clubs by just going to the college website of bit and you can search on Instagram for some clubs' names like TEDx bit, or big clubs. Our college fest's name is Mathan which is quite good you will get a chance to show yourself any talent and have a good DJ night also.",4,2,8,85.75,15.52063554,2,0
BIT,"Remarks : I get into college through the COMEDK exam. The exam consists of 180 multiple-choice questions,60 from each Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics. I got an India rank of 2856. The following are the counselling procedure Firstly, you have to verify your documents. After your documents have been verified then you have to wait for the counselling dates. Once dates have been announced then according to your rank you must fill in the choices of college with giving preference to your branch. Generally, the counselling is a 3-round process. After each round, you are given the opportunity to edit your choices. If at some round you found you want to go to the allotted college then you must accept the college by paying some college fees. But after my time there has been a slight change in the procedure. So, I would suggest you go through COMEDK's official website.
Course Curriculum Overview : I preferred the I.S.E branch because I am quite interested in coding and development stuff. Faculty members are good but they didn't have much knowledge of the core subjects.- Also, the college is very very strict towards attendance. All faculty members are qualified and have well-certified degrees.
Class Size : 60
Course Fees : INR 229710 per year

Internships Opportunities : Fidelity comes for the SDE role intern in the 4th sem. Samsung comes for an R&D role intern and full-time offer in 3rd year. Dell also comes for interns (but only for CSE girls) in 3rd year. Amazon also comes for interns in 4th year.
Placement Experience : Campus placements have been improved for 3-4 years. But again I would say It's your hard work that matters all. And in your college, not many companies come for an internship opportunity. My plan after my degree is simple I would prefer a job due to some family crisis.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : For me, the fee is 229710 per annum. But there has been a hike in fees, so please go through the college's official website for an update on the fee structure. Placement is good for 3-4 years in my college. But for internships very few companies approach college.
Campus Life : There is no campus life. If you are expecting a good campus life, then please don't come to this college. There are many active clubs such as LEO, Rotaract, GDSC, IEDC, and others. But there is no proper coding dedicated club. Infrastructure is average.",7,4,5,89.57,15.1918986,3,0
BIT,"Remarks : We apply for an exam called Come-K. The application form is available online. The fees are somewhere between 1500-2000 depending on what you choose. The orientation process takes a lot of time. One of the drawbacks of my college is its very small campus.
Course Curriculum Overview : I chose this course cause I have an interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning. The student-faculty ratio is about 30:1. The faculty are well-trained and well-educated. however, a few teachers and professors from the mech department do tend to use violence for no reason, which is a huge drawback. exams for us occurred every two weeks due to the reduced semester size, and the papers were moderately easy.
Class Size : 60
Course Fees : INR 250000 per year
Internships Opportunities : The internships that are provided by the college are mostly unpair. a few paid are available but can only be attained by the people who score the highest and are already the ""teacher's pet"". We were made to do various projects as well and had to submit one final project before we graduated.
Placement Experience : placements can be achieved from 6 th semester itself. Mnc's like amazon, google (idk they say), Wipro, Infosys, Mercedes, etc come for placements as well. the highest package as of 2022 is 33.5 lakhs. For CSE, 90% of students get good placements. I wanna complete my Mtech in artificial intelligence and machine learning after this degree for sure.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : The fees for localities are way less as compared to people joining via Comed-K. for us, the total fees per year were 2,50,000 rupees including university charges. 2,25,000 went to comed-k officials for unknown reasons. No scholarship for people outside of Karnataka (believe me I've tried looking)
Campus Life : one fest. Manthan. The fest is amazing and the events are wonderful. the only problem is the availability of space. There is no space as the campus is very small. The library has almost all the necessary books and journals. Classrooms in the main building are well equipped. There are many clubs but most of them are dead.",7,5,5.6,89.84,16.06252927,2,0
BIT,"Remarks : Eligibility:- one who has qualified COMEDK examination and is able to make the cutoff is allowed a seat in this college. Every detail is uploaded on the internet and there is no reservation for other state students. Jee marks are also not considered but scoring in COMEDK is not that tough, so you can try it. The admission process is kinda smooth and doesn't have any big issues so I don't think there is any scope for improvement.
Course Curriculum Overview : I am currently pursuing CSE so the faculty all members are well-qualified and have decent teaching skills. Well, it is the same as you may have felt at your school, some are excellent teachers and some are okayish. The faculty-student ratio is good and most of the professors are MTECH or PHDs so knowledge wise they are good. And examinations are easy for someone who has prepared for jee, so you can manage with one all-nighter before the examination. I would suggest someone rely more on youtube and focus on other skills and not just focus on marks but your college scores should not degrade as well.
Class Size : 60
Course Fees : INR 260000 per year
Internships Opportunities : Plenty of on-campus placement opportunities, you just have to work on your skills and you will get that. You must learn stuff, you may do any research paper or you may do an off-campus internship as well
Placement Experience : Placement is good, everyone in CSE, and ECE cracks placement. The average package is also good, it fluctuates between 9-11 lakhs every year. So it is not a big deal. The highest package is 35 lpa by Mercedes, companies like Adobe also give good placement and as you know it's Bangalore so there are not many job-related issues.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : It is one of the problems of college the fee is extremely high as per facilities. Those who are from other states and are considering taking admission through COMEDK must know that you are going to pay more than the people of Karnataka and it is going to be twice. A normal Karnataka person pays approximately 1 lakhs and me from another state pay 2.5 lakhs for college and 1 lakhs for pg/hostel, so it is going to be costly. There is no scholarship for other state students and for Karnataka students there are plenty of scholarship programmes (state govt+ scholarship for females).
Campus Life : Pathetic college life, one who is aiming for a good college life should know that the campus is on 7 acres, pretty decent, right? But there are 11 other colleges on this small campus so it makes it extremely difficult to good college life, there are not enough sports facilities and not enough Co-curricular clubs. It's just a college of nerds, so better decide before considering it. There are plenty of nerd activities so you may like that.

BIT,"Remarks : You should score rank under 12k for the safer side for the ECE branch. The application form will be available in the website search Comedk. For Karnataka students, there is another exam held at KCET. They can take admission through it by paying less fee which is 75k per year.
Course Curriculum Overview : I choose this course only because my rank falls under this range. The faculty is good they really do hard to make students learn but this is an engineering college you have to learn on your own. The teachers are really good except for some.
Class Size : 62
Course Fees : INR 230000 per year
Internships Opportunities : The internship opportunity is good as now recently fidelity came for 4th sem students to give internship having stipend of 70k. And many more companies have to come like Samsung, Adobe etc. So it's good.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : The cost of the study is too high as it cost more than 2 LPA for doing only graduation but it is in Bangalore which is a costly city. So, living here will cost you more. In short, you will have to pay extra for it.
Campus Life : The College campus is too small as it consists of only one-two buildings. Everything come under one building whole department. You will not have college life here but you can enjoy your college life if you have good friends outside the college.",2,2,6.8,87.93,14.83540146,0,0
BIT,"Remarks : The actual admission process was quite efficient, there was no improvement needed, just that vtu should release the results faster and give more clarity on how to apply for the colleges and how the admission and kcet process goes on.
Course Curriculum Overview : I got a rank of 5.3k in kcet, so one of the best available choices for my year is to choose BIT Information science, I got the seat in my 2 and 3 rd round, although the infrastructure is not good as compared to all other colleges out there the ambience and the friendly atmosphere they provide is actually good. Faculty qualifications are up to date, the ratio is good and the time provided for us for the preparation for the exam is efficient enough to cope with all the portions.

Speaking about the pros and cons of teachers everywhere you will find good and average teachers, and so do my college. But they are very supportive. The college comes under VTU university and My session is the corona session , so my session is running bit late but all the exams and all are conducted by VTU. All decisions are made by VTU only.

BIT,"Remarks : I have got the govt seat at my college by KCET exam, my college (BIT) is at top 1 for VTU Affiliated colleges and at 5th position including all colleges in Karnataka (autonomous and non autonomous) , My Kcet rank was 2500 and COMEDK rank was 3500, i have applied using KCET rank because i will get govt scholarship for every year . During counseling there are many kota through which you can get seat in top colleges.
Course Curriculum Overview : I chose the ECE course because i had intrest in both electrical and software knowledge, and during placements i might get more opportunities, but at our college majorly IT companies seeking for CSE graduates, so i got the chance but curriculum was not enough for us to get higher package. My college is known for only placements, there are not much opportunities to grow your personality or do anything new. Either you have to create opportunity for yourself and others or just simply live the college life. It is very easy to score if you are able to by heart everything because syllabus topics in each modules are not even related and there is no practical and theoretical relation between concepts.
Class Size : 80
Course Fees : INR 75000 per year
Internships Opportunities : There are mostly paid internships ( paid by students not companies) that to just give certificates and complete the formalities of internships. The issue is not the opportunities are less , main issue is that NOC for internship is given just 1 month by our college, so many govt organizations also avoid giving internship to VTU colleges,(e.g:- DRDO). Project evaluation is light because they have to pass lot of students, due lackness in curriculum. But on bright side internship status is improving from this year ,labs are getting started by many companies. Our college social media is active for any announcements.
Placement Experience : From 6th sem students are eligible for campus placements, companies starts approaching with internship opportunities with Pre-placement offers, then just after 6th sem companies starts with offers with 3-4 LPA and further, on an average 6-8 LPA packages are offered to students. And full placement chances are provided to every students but some students learn for Gate examination.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : For KCET students pay 75k is the yearly fees along with scholarship options, COMEDK students pay 1 lakh for a year excluding hostel charges ( which are by the way 1 lakh) , i got govt scholarship for clearing each semester with distinction around 50k . During placements i got 3 offers one from cognizant , mahindra and Oracle, so you will get good companies if your CSE concepts are good and applicable in real scenarios.
Campus Life : Our college's fest name is MANTHAN and it us theme based each year, our college building is only single building so there is less space for functions and our fests are organised by clearing the parking lot space infron of dental college. College clubs are made by students only and promoted by them only but all the financial things are taken care by faculty of the branch. There are big organization's clubs in college, TEDx , Rotract, Art of Living, Leo club etc. There are manh chances you can create your own cult and it can group if followed by juniors.",7,10,7,63.63,22.29730919,-3,0
BIT,"Remarks : All right, it's gonna be an honest unbiased opinion. If you're coming from CET it's definitely worth the college. If you're coming from COMED-K its fees are being increased year by year. But looking at a recent couple of years' placements, I would say it's still with it. Now if coming through Donations, which was 5.5LPA (in 2019) now, it's around 6 LPA, well I would suggest going for another College like Ramaiah or RVCE ONLY. Now coming to Campus of college, it's really really a small man. JUST 1 main building, No ground, no GYM, Swimming pool or anything. (Although, there's a ground nearby, National College ground.) After joining there would be something called counselling days for 1 week, where they'll tell you about CGPA, SGPA, CTC, and many other kinds of stuff, try to attend 1-2 classes minimum. Well, the principal Dr Ashwath MU is a very humble person(yet busy). He encourages us to do workshops and participate in Hackathon events, etc.
Course Curriculum Overview : I chose CSE because it's something that I love since childhood, (also the package is very hefty, not to forget that). (totally there are 3 sections each having 60-65 students). Faculty to student ratio is like 1:60 in theory classes, but in Lab, it's divided into 4 sections of 60 students of each class, and 2 teachers in each lab, So it's a 2:15 ratio. Some faculty members are boring, some are very interested in teaching, they know the way of teaching their subjects, (but these teachers' count is very less). Qualification of faculties are good almost all facilities have PhD and Masters degrees (in CSE DEPT at least). Coming to exams, there is 3 internals to be taken, usually every month once an internal, some assignments are also given which includes 5 marks of your overall internal result. Internals pressure is normal, you can easily handle the sub, in 3-4 days before internals, but for externals, faculties will scare you like hell, you gotta be prepared about a month before it.
Class Size : 67
Course Fees : INR 89000 per year
Internships Opportunities : Internships will be there for you after the 4th semester usually there's a company called fidelity investments which offered 35k per month for 10 students from any dept. Just they need to clear coding round and interview round and that's it they have the internship two of my friends for this internship, they said that they will teach you selenium and spring boot and you'll work in those two skills for six months and internship will be over. All students have their own choice to do internships from other sites like Internshala or any other companies.
Placement Experience : From the fourth semester, you become eligible for internships, and from the sixth semester, you become eligible for campus placements. Our Principal has signed MOU with many companies (Oracle, Adobe, Cisco are some product based companies) so a good amount of companies come to our college for placements, and this year's (2021) highest placement was of 20LPA(One direct) by 3 students of CSE, and avg package was - 6.65LPA (it's for CSE/ISE dept only). Almost all students (without backlogs) have got placements, so you can say it's 100% placements. Our college provides exclusive interview and placements preparation (ofc additional charges like 2k ) but it makes sure that all students become worthy for sitting in placements.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : For CET students, as I said it's definitely worth the fees is around 90k including all admission fees and college tuition fees. For COMEDK students, the fees were around 2.3L P.A in 2019, Now it's been increased to 2.5L per annum, For donation/management studies- it was 5.5 L per year, in 2019, and it keeps increasing year by year, now it's around 6.25L SCHOLARSHIPS ARE FOR CET students that too with SC/ST criteria only.
Campus Life : The campus is very small, we have only 2 badminton courts and 2 table tennis, and other indoor games like carrom, chess, etc. But during fest (MANTHAN) which generally occurs during March-April we'll get to see many other sports and games events, and dance, singing, skits, and many other things too. The 2 most popular events are - kabbadi league and Mini Cricket. Oh, those were a great fun man. Clubs are many, some general clubs, some Department specific like aerospace and mechanical clubs, etc. But the most popular club is RCBIT they conduct many events. Also in September every year, they'll plan trips for hiking/trekking, 2-3 buses are booked and set off early in the morning. Talking about the library, there are 3 libraries- 1. Digital library, you can only read digital content there (computers). 2. General lib- it contains all books of all semesters and reference books as well, but generally old books, so you gotta purchase from outside 3. self lib- bring your own book and sit & study there.
Hostel Facilities : Hostel review, fees is a little bit expensive as compared to other colleges' Hostels, but considering the fact that it's in the heart of B'lore city, I think it's fair. Beware of Bed bugs in a hostel, mess food is OKAYISH. The good thing is just by walkable distance there are many hospitals and shops. The best part is it's just in front of Metro, so communication is awesome and cheap. Pro tip- Grab/Buy your metro passes ASAP, it'll be beneficial. Still, if you don't wanna be in the hostel then, there are many PGs nearby within a 1 Km radius but their food quality is even worse than the hostel. Personally, I've tasted it. But rooms are clean and spacious unlike here in our hostel. So the choice is yours.",10,1,7.7,80.91,18.20376286,9,0
BIT,"Remarks : I am in Bangalore institute of technology (BIT) as I have given JEE mains and got good rank so I applied for many NITs like Allahabad, Kurukshetra, Jaipur and etc but I am getting a good branch in BIT Bangalore and as the college is very popular and very good in placement so I chose BIT Bangalore. The admission criteria are very simple you have to give COMEDK OR KCET exam and if you got an eligible rank then you can get to this college through counseling. My counseling is online but it's very good and fast also and for proper admission, I have to go to college and submit my documents.
Course Curriculum Overview : I chose my course because is electronic and I like to do something in the future. The faculty in BIT is very good they are all are helpful and very there are many faculty in the branch and all are very well educated and also their teaching methods are also good and easy to understand. We have you internals every 1.5 months. Exams are easy but also tough sometimes.

There are many rooms and pg available near the college in fact flats are also available.",7,10,6.8,73.05,18.43608175,-3,0
BIT,"Remarks : Enrollment was through COMED-K merit. I had a rank of 4000 and I could not get the college in the first counselling however I got the seat in the 2nd round. The registration process in the college was pretty simple.
Course Curriculum Overview : Faculty to student ratio is pretty good as there is only a section of 60 students per year and a good faculty strength supporting it. All the teachers are highly educative. There are 3 internal examinations and all of them are mandatory. The questions in the internals are the questions we practise in the lectures.
Class Size : 60

Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : Financially the college is a bit expensive and so is the region. Students from outside Karnataka have to pay 2,10,100 whereas local students have to pay about 40,000. Hikes are based on COMED-K guidelines. The men's hostel costs over 80,000 a year and is next to the college whereas the women's hostel is about 10km far.
Campus Life : Annual and Tech fests are fun but biased. There are no north Indian bands or singers or dancers contacted for any event. The library is great. All the course related books are available and are in stock. Classrooms are an average based on the fees charged, there are limited smart boards. There is no ground inside the college only a badminton arena, however, there is a ground nearby(500mts) where the college has ties.
Hostel Facilities : The rooms in the hostel are good. The room consists of bunk beds or ordinary beds, a cupboard per person, a table and a chair per person. The meals are provided four times a day. Meals are average. Getting a room in the hostel is quite difficult as it gets filled quite early.",7,6,7.8,89.53,16.1142595,1,0
DSU,"Course Curriculum Overview :

Faculty members are good. The way of teaching is really Appreciable and they are friendly too. There is a total of 65 students in each class and like this 16 sections are made for the First Year. A total of around 50 Teachers.

Many companies like Amazon, Accenture, and TCS come to our campus for hiring most of the students to get placed here with an average package of 7.14LPA and the Highest package of 28LPA. Also, some of the students got international packages. In our College, around 80% of the students get placed. I would like to do a Masters or Mtech in Computer Science and Engineering.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions :

I got into this college through kcet. I had to pay an additional 32,000 to get admission. I have applied for online scholarships I didn't receive any college scholarships yet. Maybe I'll get more opportunities for the scholarship in the future but right now I didn't get any of my money back.
Campus Life :

As I joined this college recently so I don't know much about the fests. But last week there was a program to provide information about cyber security and also about aeronautics. Those were very useful for beginners and I recently came to know that the convocation is to be held on campus.
Admission :

Admission was quite easy. They took 32000 as admission fees and kept 3 sets of documents, the payment method was online. I had to fill all my details in the Computer later I was able to log in to the student portal on the official DSU website.",2,1,8.3,80.26,16.73571865,1,0

Loan/ Scholarship Provisions :

Fees structure of my university is approx 25000 for each department. There are scholarships that the university provides but they are only for local students (Karnataka students), and there are no scholarships for outside Karnataka students.
Campus Life :

In terms of campus life, it is not satisfying. No there is no such annual fest or tech fest which is conducted by the college. Hardly there are few activities based on sports & extracurricular activities which are conducted on campus",6,10,7.4,72.02,17.04837466,-4,0
DSU,"Remarks :

The Admission could be taken via Management Seat, DCET Entrance Examination, KCET or COMED-K. Management Seat will cost you around 3 lakh rupees, COMED-K and DCET will be 2.5 lakh and KCET will be around 1.5 lakh. I took admission via KCET Quota and the cutoff is not usually High (Less Comparitively to the Same Infrastructure Colleges ). A ranking of less than 35k will get you a seat in the Computer Science or EC Branches in Engineering. The Notifications about the Admission Process for the DCET and Management can be found on Dsu official website OBC and SC/ST People have an Edge in KCET Admission Process
Course Curriculum Overview :

I knew that Computer Science Engineering has a Good Job Scope and is a bit easy compared to other fields The student ratio is 1: 35-40 (For Every Student there are 35 to 40 students) The teachers have their PhD and M.tech in their respective fields. The teachers are good by Experienced teachers by adding freshers. It gets a bit difficult.

There is no Fee hike, The fees which had been mentioned in the first year is continued for all four years. (There is a fine for late fee i.e 100 rupees for a single day ) The Scholarship we get is via SSP Scholarship given by the Karnataka government which may vary from 15k to 60k Based on the Caste We regularly get internship opportunities from Colleges and Other Sources.
Campus Life :

There is an Annual Fest Organized every year. But they are not so great as compared to other colleges.

DSU,"Remarks :

I didn't go through lot of trouble in the aplication . because i applied through K-CET . My CET rank was 48000 and i have SC reservation . But i don't know the cutoffs But there is DSAT a direct exam for all DSI but the fee is higher than that of CET asmission. All i had to do was bring the original documents with fee and block my CET seat . i don't know much about the original admission process so i personally don't have any improvements to suggest.
Course Curriculum Overview :

because computer knowledge is the present day prrofitable asset . i want that assest. The faculties are good but not all,that is given because everyone have there style of teaching and it doesn't connect with students though and the teaching method implemented is excellent actually but very hard to follow within the currebt time constraint bacause we are the Covid batch , the system is to provide extra materials handmade by the top facuty member of that particular course and also to insist on reading teh texting wih mini projects and seminars for every subject . although this seems ideal but it becomes hectic both for students and lecturers to follow such brain wacking schedule within a short period of a semestermostly students only read the material and are confined to knowledge of the materials.

Hostel Facilities :

The hostel is pretty good but the cost is way too high and quite unprefarable by many of the students. In my recommendation for the first year of college, one should definitely stay in the hostel and later move out to PGs or Rooms. One can find a number of PGs near the campus in Kudlu Gate Junction behind Udupi Upahar and Hyundai Showroom both for girls as well as boys. Many rented rooms and flats are available behind campus as well in Singasandra, AECS A layout.",2,2,7.8,81.12,17.57634409,0,0

No I opted for a pg which was near the college. 4 sharing, with washing machine, wife, 3 times food and hot water. It costed me 6000 a month that’s around 72000 a year which is cheaper than the hostel.

Alumni/Alumna :

We only had one batch before us so no alumni interactions as such. But all my seniors got placed in a really good companies.
Admission :

I got admission thourough cet in 2016 I passed out of 12th. I had a ranking of 18000 and I got into a the college in the 3rd round. I chose computer science, college was in my ranking range. You take all your documents and go for the admission once you get your admission ticket.
Faculty :

Cs alone has 60 prof. Every one is a MTech holder and some of them are phd holder. Most of the prof are from iit and have their own research. Ml,cloud etc. no industry experience teaching cause everyone is intreated to teach what’s in the text book rather focus on industry level experience.",7,6,6.8,92.57,14.57881137,1,0
DSU,"Remarks :

You will definitely get placed, If you are eligible for placements, Means that if you don’t have any tear back or back subject then you are eligible for placements and then you will be placed. I’ll suggest B. Tech (CSE) is best over here.
Course Curriculum Overview :

All the faculty are very talented, They will teach you right things, All are experienced and have good knowledge of industry trends, They will teach you the trending subjects as optionals subjects like IOT, ML, And Data Science. Exam is of 2 type, Internal and External
Placement Experience :

This college has one of the best placements in similar category college. During my time all students who were sitting for placements got offer letter of minimum one company. Many got 3-4 offer letters also
College Events :

There are many events about which we can talk including DJ Nights, Bollywood Night, Guest Lecture from ISRO or foreign universities, Local festivals, sports events, cultural events and these are just to name a few.
Fee Structure And Facilities :

It depends on the weather you live in karnataka or outside karnataka. For students if karnataka, it’s feasible, For students from other part of country, Its average, neither feasible nor expensive, Somewhere in between.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions :

If you are from karnataka, All govt scholarships will be applicable, And if you are from Army background also then its a good news, If none of the above applies, Then you have to pay the total fee, You don’t have any options. and that’s unfortunate. I would suggest DSI groups to proved some scholarships to non-karnataka students also.
Campus Life :

Labs are excellent, No Doubt. All tech legends like IBM, VMWare, NVEDIA etc have their research labs inside the campus. All interested candidates can go and learn, Thats all free of cost. Sports is something which can make you sad. They don’t have well organised sports activity on which they were working when I passed.
Hostel Facilities :

They have world class hostel, you can opt for hostel if you are from outside bangalore, thats the best option for first year. The only thing thay lag behind is they don’t have single share rooms. Minimum 2 share is what you can opt for as a 1st tear student.

Alumni/Alumna :

They have good alumni network, All get invites annually, All gather up and enjoy the friendship together. And I don’t have much knowledge on it apart from what I said above. I just got passed and hot invite to alumni meet which is going to happen next week then I can answer this question better.
Admission :

One need to clear the entrance test namely DSAT, Once you cleared the test, go thourough the normal process that is check for the seats available based on your rank and branch. If seat available, Then you can take admission in that branch.
Faculty :

All hare P. Hd degree holders and most of them have industry experience also. They keep a track of industry trends and will guide you accordingly so that you can achieve your career goals. If you are thinking to be a part of DSI Group, I’ll say Go On.",3,2,8.5,82.12,18.01785714,1,0
DSU,"Remarks :

One of the most negative things about this college that has to be considered is the place or region, It's situated on NHAI hosur main road,kudlu gate, For your information this region is in one of bangalore's top 5 highest traffic point ever. College timings are 8:45am to 4:45 pm for CSE and 3:30pm for other departments. Traffic reaches peak after 5:30. This is the main suffering if you are a student of this college. Locals here don't know the pain, they are used to as they stay nearby. If you are staying anywhere 5-6km away from college be ready to face the pain 4long years. None can explain the pain of traveling 2.5 hours morning and 3hours returning home other than me as I stay 20kms away. Somehow suffered 3long years. Keep in mind when you take admission through DSAT you are admitted to DSU kudlu gate and not DSCE. Please take this seriously before joining this college else your graduation gets messed up.This is a pain in me for my mistake. Other than this academics and all future opportunities are positive. You certificate will be backed up by a brand name ""Dayananda Sagar"" wherever you go. All the Best
Course Curriculum Overview :

Ours campus here in kudlu gate (unlike main campus in kumarswamy layout) is by name called ""innovation campus"" for its various tech-labs present in the campus. Nvidia, bosch- rexroth, vmware, GE labs are some of them, so these make little extra practical along with course curriculum being foundation to it, we have (be it any sem) 4 labs a week. Out of which 2 are important as there are 2 lab exams, the other two are just information purposes or acquiring skills. Overall course curriculum is ok but becoming hectic as they adding new courses every year to previous semesters by looking at other Universities the juniors said.
Placement Experience :

As I've still not come across placements and interview thing. I lack clear knowledge about it but as per our seniors about 40% combining students from all the departments get placed every year with average 5lakh package. Also as I mentioned earlier about our innovation campus there is a one floor small startup ( a workplace) called derbi foundation, eligible students have an option of doing internships there, this year for seniors tcs,Infosys, mind tree and few companies from Japan(don't know their names) had visited and highest was for two students with 16lpa and 12lpa from those Japan companies. And tcs, Infosys and mindtree offered 4-6lpa package. Those Japan companies are mass recruiters for our college xD
College Events :

No events at all, seriously once in two years that too upon requesting and forcing the management,all happens in our main campus college DSCE,even if we have it's small ethnic day or kannada rajyostava (too rare), since ours is a group of institutions they say fest will be celebrated once for all three campuses, but there is no participation from our campus it's only from DSCE. There is no much crowd during fests in our college, it's only 50-60 ppl. Almost everyone hates to come to that high traffic point when there is no class or no serious reason. Not just fests there is very little importance given to sports. No ground no facilities nothing.0 enjoyment or entertainment. You need to create one if you are interested
Fee Structure And Facilities :

College charges 40 thousand extra to that of entrance test fee as college fee. Ex: Total KCET seat fee = KCET fee+ college fee. CET fee is 56k generally,so total CET seat fee =56k+40k = 96k ie 1lakh *appros even if you have a merit seat allotted. Admission by Comedk goes the same. For admission through DSAT test, a donation of 4 lakh while admission + 1.8lakh fee every year is to be paid. And legendary management fees keeps changing every year and depends on the student.his/her 12 marks. Usually 4lakh every year may be *no idea of clear figures. Getting seat through management or DSAT by paying such high fees is definitely not worth to this college. not just this college but management in any engineering college in general.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions :

There is no scholarship that is offered exclusively by the college, but it procceses other scholarships from government or other organizations if any. There is student loan facility from icici,hdfc,kotak and SBI banks with which the college has partnered. There are other loan plans as well other than banks which I don't know.
Campus Life :

You can find 0% importance given to extra curricular activities and it's only academics and academics related activities like practicals, seminar,or quizzes. Student Gender ratio is 50:50. Only in mech departments it's 90 male:10 female ratio. Again in faculties and staff it's 40 male:60 female ratio. There are no such student or dorm parties formed. And few faculties as I said are partial towards race and religion.except that no other tolerance would be required.
Hostel Facilities :

I don't stay in hostel but as per my hostel mate. it's 1.5lakh a year per head in a hostel room shared by 4. Infrastructure is quite good and maintenance and service is done regularly. 1.5lakh per head includes the stay,food, maintenance,and college bus fees. But hostel accommodation is very limited.In case of pg's you can get near BTM layout which is 3kms away. It starts at 6-7k a month for a decent PG.

Alumni/Alumna :

Seniors are a hope or stress buster. They help with their cool talks and tell us about future happenings. In the beginning when joined most of the seniors showed their hatred towards joining this college. They told about all the sufferings they have had with this college.
Admission :

I got admission for CSE branch based on my KCET rank, the cutoff rank for CET merit for this college was below average which was why any average student could easily get a seat. There are four engineering departments in this college (CSE,ECE,MECH, Aeronautical). If not KCET you can even enter by private entrance DSAT conducted by the university and success rate is always 95% through DSAT.decent 12th knowledge is enough to clear it. Also fee paid by DSAT students is twice of that paid by KCET. IF not these, the famous ""management quota "" is always there. fee maybe 4-4.5lakhs *appros per year.
Faculty :

Only 50% of the teaching faculty are actually a bunch of clear knowledge of whatever they teach. The rest pretend to be extremely super pros but in reality there not which any student like me can easily identify. But almost 90% of faculties are phd's wonder how. Or majority have the knowledge and understanding but do not know how to teach those. Some faculties are there they judge students based on their previous sem marks and by discussing with faculties who handled the class previously and some in worst case by looking at students face(like hard to mention few see caste and religion of students *disgusting) and it's a private institution marks depends on opinion teacher have on you (as I told they Judge) very few not all faculties. (these are my opinion and need not be a fact).",3,0,7.5,84.62,16.29724669,3,0
DSU,"Remarks :

College was huge as it consists of schools to engineering, dental, polytechnic and many other courses. As it made the campus very diverse. The negative thing about the campus is, it was not of na budget friendly as the canteen or the coffee bar used to have no concession for campus students.
Course Curriculum Overview :

The course curriculum was filled with lot of interesting subjects, even though my freshman year included all common subjects which wasn't related to any of my core subjects but still had to pass through but once I got in to my core department it was very interesting. There used to be 3 internals and one external exam for every semester. Few times it used to be a hectic semester and sometimes it used to be chilled semester.
Placement Experience :

There is a specific placement cell in my College and all giant software companies including Infosys, Wipro and many other come to campus for hiring. For aeronautical there was no core company in the campus. The College didn't provided any internship directly but the faculty used to advice us for choosing the right internships by providing the required support. I did my internship in HAL and the stipend was very minimal.
College Events :

Our College used to hold technical and cultural fest differently for whole College as well as the department separately, our College fest name is furore and it's very vibrant. Out department technical fest is Aviano and it had all the aspects covering technical things.
Fee Structure And Facilities :

The fee structure for DSU is considered to be on a higher scale, apart from the CET fee the College used to take separate College fee which was around 50% of the total CET fee. When I was studying I use dto pay 33k as CET fee and 16k for College fee for a year.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions :

I have availed the scholarship for 3 continuous year based on my marks which I scored. I used to get 16k (the amount I paid as College fee) back as a scholarship amount. The College had a separate office for scholarship where students can apply on various criteria whether it may be academics, caste or the sports and after evaluating the Application the College used to provide the scholarship.
Campus Life :

Our College use to entertain the extra curricular activities whether it may cultural fest or the sports. All the necessary backing was provided by College. The labs were of high standards. Gender ratios usually depends upon the stream like in Mechanical stream it's always the boys majority and in CS and IS it used to be girls majority.
Alumni/Alumna :

Our College has a separate alumni registered association and every year the College will have alumni meet for whole College on last week of December. The department wise meet will also be conducted and it was always Great to meet your friends who now work in different paths.
Admission :

I got admission through CET- Karnataka, where during the counselling I selected College of my choice and course and it's was Aeronautical in DSU. Once the seat was confirmed then I visited the College paid the College fee apart from the CET fee which was during the counselling and I still had a option of taking other Colleges during the next round but I stick to the same.
Faculty :

Since it was a new branch in the College and very few Colleges offered this stream in the state, our College was equipped with very good laboratories and lecturers. Whether it may be the windtunnel or the miniature propeller engine and also real aircraft. Our Head of the department was also a wing Commander in Indian air Force previously which gave all of us a better understanding of the field.",4,8,7.7,72.87,18.67477198,-4,0

MIT,"Remarks : I had applied to VIT, Vellore, but decided to not attend it as I was not sure of the surroundings outside the main campus. The town of Manipal had much more accessible enterprises like shops, restaurants, movie theatres etc. Apart from that, I felt that my course, Biotechnology had a much better curriculum at MIT. The minimum mark for getting admission was 50% in PCM/Biology/Computer Science The counseling day was quite straightforward. I had to submit a few documents such as ID card, marksheets etc. and opt for a branch of my choosing.
Course Curriculum Overview : I have always been interested in biotechnology and the course at Manipal gave me a choice of multiple electives in the higher semesters. This gave rise to a flexible curriculum which I could select according to my interests. Considering the entirety of BTech Biotechnology (Year 1 to Year 4), the faculty: student ratio was approximately 1:12, which provided a great deal of mentorship and one on one guidance. The faculty at the department is highly qualified and pursues research as well. There are various fields being covered, ranging from drug delivery to fermentation. As for the evaluation, we had in-class assignments for 20 marks (4 assignments per subject, 5 marks each) and two 15 mark midterm examinations. For the end semester examination, there were written exams and practicals.

There were a total of 8 rounds of counselling and the timings of which were coordinated through email.
Course Curriculum Overview : I chose aeronautical engineering as I had an interest in the branch for quite some time. This college is known for maintaining a pretty good faculty to student ratio, which means you as a student will always have a teacher to clear your doubts. All facilities are highly qualified. Most of them have degrees up to PhD level. There are 50 marks of internal exams and 50 marks worth of end semester exams. They are not very difficult if the basic concepts are clear, there are no complex and tricky questions and there is also a possibility of scoring full marks in these exams.

Internships Opportunities : I am still in the 2nd semester and you can go for an internship from the 5th semester onwards. But as far I have heard from the seniors, there are available options that the college provides and apart from that you can also go outside for your internship.
Placement Experience : Students become eligible for campus placement after the 6th semester or they can apply for project work for the 7th and 8th semesters. 50 fortune 500 companies came for placement in 2020 with the highest being 48 lpa and an average of 11 lpa. I enrolled in this university because of the high %age of students placed. This year, in 2020, almost 90 % of the students were placed. I myself will be looking forward to getting a good paying job at the campus placement cell.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : Fees of the BTech course is to be paid in a span of 4 years. The amount to be paid varies according to the branch you opt though it is somewhere around 15-19 lakhs.

Campus Life : There is an annual fest called revels at MIT and a technical fest known as tech-tatva. Due to covid this year these were conducted online. There is a huge central library inside the campus with the availability of all academic books required. Due to covid, I was unable to fully check the library. The classrooms can hold the strength of about 90 students with a large blackboard accompanied by a smartboard. There are a lot of open grounds for sports, there are badminton courts and fully equipped basketball courts spread throughout the campus. There are also a lot of technical and non-technical clubs and also many student projects.

MIT,"Remarks : I applied for mechanical engineering in 1. National Institute of Technology 2. Manipal Institute of Technology The reason I did not get into NITs is that, since I am not an Indian, I had to get into one via SAT Subject tests. Even though I was getting mechanical in almost any NIT, the fees were almost 8 lacs higher for me than MIT (or even BITS if I had applied in it after getting suitable marks). Therefore, I took admission to MIT, which was my backup college. I had given MET in which I got a rank of 6284. I got mechanical engineering in the first round itself (General category, since it is all merit based). I guess the cutoff in the last round was 19000. I had heard a lot of good things about mechanical engineering in Manipal. I am about to finish my first year, and though we had our year mostly via online classes, the one month offline classes and experience gave us a brief idea about the campus. The workshops are massive, and the faculty of the mechanical branch is pretty good too.
Course Curriculum Overview : I always wanted to choose mechanical engineering for my love of machines and cars. We generally have nearly 90 students in a class (rooms are pretty big). Since it was covid this year, the offline classes hardly had 45 students in a class (sections were divided into 2). Mechanical faculty is actually pretty good, and many teachers have a good way of teaching. Faculty from other branches are also pretty good (like physics, electronics etc.). We have quizzes and assignments pretty frequently (weekly) and midterms and end sems every 2 to 2 and a half months. Offline exams were not that hard. Passing is not at all difficult. Online exams though have a higher difficulty level.
Class Size : 45
Course Fees : INR 430000 per year

Internships Opportunities : Internships can be done from the first year itself if anyone wants to via sites like Internshala etc. There are student projects such as formula Manipal, Moto Manipal etc which help in building up the resume, CVs etc.
Placement Experience : If I'm not wrong, campus placements start from the 3rd year. Companies include Daimler, Bosch and many others. I'm not sure about the number of offers though, it is available on the main website. The highest package every year is above 40-45 lpa ( I guess it is for CSE). Not sure percentage, but many students also go for higher studies. I plan to go for higher studies.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : For mechanical engineering, the fees for first year is 325000 and from the next year onwards it is around 430000. So, for 4 years, it is around 16 lacs. I heard that we get scholarships for people who have a rank below 5k in MET, and also scholarships for the people with lower economic status (needs to apply for and an exam needs to be given). Many people go for internships in 3rd year.
Campus Life : This is probably one of the best areas of Manipal. The campus life at Manipal is just phenomenal. Clubs and student projects are plenty and helpful. Social life is pretty awesome too. There are sports grounds, complexes, pools etc. Classrooms have speakers all over to amplify the teacher's voice. Very well maintained classrooms and infrastructure. The Library is also pretty big, many research papers are also available. There is also a library site for accessing papers and books online.
Hostel Facilities : Hostels are of different kinds. The old ones with common washrooms and new ones with attached washrooms and more privacy. Anyways, hostels are pretty well maintained. Messes and food courts are also pretty good, with decent quality food at almost all times. Registration is done through the hostel site (hostel.manipal.edu). As far as affordability is concerned, prices range from under a lac to almost 1.7 or 1.8 lacs including mess. I currently live in Hostel 5, which is one of the older blocks with common washrooms and higher affordability.

MIT,"Remarks : I applied for Bharti Vidyapeeth Pune but was refused because of their placement record as well as the salary. It wasn't satisfactory. For students from the General category, like me want to take admission to the Manipal Institute of Technology, have to clear their own entrance exam MET(Manipal Entrance Test). The eligibility criteria (for Indian boards was that the student should be 10+2 pass or equivalent with Physics, Mathematics and English as compulsory subjects along with Chemistry/biotechnology /biology /any technical vocational subject as optional, from a recognized board, with a minimum of 50% aggregate marks taken together in Physics, Mathematics and any one of the optional subjects. MET has 4 sections Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, and English. Each section has 200 marks each so a total 800 marks test. We got our results in 2-3 weeks and were asked to fill in details for the desired branch.
Course Curriculum Overview : Chemical engineering is a growing field in these times. Especially during these times where new diseases are on a spree and quick medicines and vaccines are required, the soil is becoming infertile for agriculture, plastic pollution is becoming an interesting problem and various other elements are yet to be discovered. There's going to be a lot of opportunity and creativity for chemical engineers. The student ratio is about 6:1 which is very impressive. The teachers are extremely fluent and well-read about the subject. Almost every teacher has done Masters in their subjects and their explanation is excellent. Our doubts are cleared immediately. Our terms exams were at a moderate level and the questions were targeting our understanding of concepts. The checking of paper was done accurately and correct marks were given.

Internships Opportunities : There are several student projects that deal with solar mobiles, satellite making, Robo Manipal, and several others. Students work rigorously on it and every student has to seriously participate in the development of the project.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : The fees are very high. Every course per year fees is more than 4 lacs and it's increasing every year. Not everyone can afford to pay this amount. The students who were amongst the top rankers in the MET were given a scholarship. The fees can be paid in installments per year. Their aren't any campus jobs. But enthusiastic students start their own start-up from their initial years in the college and if the college finds it interesting they provide them with heavy funds to develop their business.
Campus Life : The annual fest is Revels which happens at the end of March. The tech fest is called the Techfest, which for the 2020 batch happened in November. They have a huge library and there are a lot of books of various genres and journals. The classrooms are very big with speakers in every corner for the students to hear when teachers use the microphone. Every classroom has a projector. There are 2 basketball and badminton courts each, a lawn tennis court, table tennis, football, and cricket ground, running tracks, and 3 volleyball courts. There is a 7 storey building Marena, specially dedicated to all sports and games and gym.

Hostel Facilities : There are various options for the rooms. Common room, triple bed non-ac common bath, double bed ac/non-ac common bathroom/ attached bathroom. Single ac bathroom attached. The rooms have study tables, a wardrobe, and a mattress. The room is cleaned every alternate day. The food is delicious and healthy. The registration for hostel room booking can be done through their website. The rooms with more facilities like ac and attached bathrooms are extremely expensive also the rooms with sharing and common bathroom are expensive. Many students in their 3rd year choose to move out from the hostel and rent their own apartment.",6,5,9.2,78.22,18.05832583,1,0
MIT,"Remarks : I had applied for Manipal Institute of Technology and Vellore Institute of Technology, I ended up going to MIT because of good reviews by some known alumni and chose not to go to VIT because of the very strict and obnoxious environment I heard & read about on some online forums. I did my BTech in Industrial & Production Engineering and the minimum marks required for the course at that time was around 100-110 out of 200. The admission process was quite smooth and the people were very cooperative.
Course Curriculum Overview : I had an interest in the working of the industrial setups and this course had a few management courses as well which is why I ended up going for this course. The faculty: student ratio is more than decent, you will never face overcrowding and the teachers are really helpful. All the professors there are highly qualified in their respective fields, of course, every professor has their own teaching method and it depends on what kind of method do you prefer for yourself. We had 2 sets of sessionals, some internal assignments, and then finally the end semester exams. If you have been the lectures carefully and made thorough notes then it's not difficult to pass these exams at all.

Internships Opportunities : More than 300 companies from various different sectors participated in MIT's placement drive 2020. Goldman Sachs,Amazon,Deloitte,Sabre,Ugam,Samsung,Miscrosoft,L&T,IBM India,Cisco,Baxter, BlackRock, Infosys,Oracle.Wipro,Siemens just to name a few.
Placement Experience : After the 6th semester, the students are eligible for campus placements. A-Z hundreds of companies come to MIT,Manipal for placements. Avg package would be around 7.50 lacs. More than 90% of the students get placed.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : The cost of some courses is lesser than the others. I think the placements of students from specific branches does factor in the fees hike. A lot of companies come for the campus placements to MIT, Manipal, especially after MAHE, got accorded as Institute of Eminence by HRD Government of India.
Campus Life : Even semesters have the Cultural fests called ""Revels"" and odd semesters have the Tech fest called ""Tech-Tatva"". Manipal has one of the largest libraries in Asia so you will never run out of books and journals. The classrooms are very well equipped for smart learning through projectors as well as the traditional blackboards and all classrooms are Air-conditioned. MIT has a huge array of extracurricular clubs for the students to join in almost all the fields be it sports, dramatics, music, technical clubs, etc. I myself was a part of one of the most popular, one of the oldest, and a club with the richest history of winning trophies called ""Aaina Dramatics"". Mostly all the clubs are run by the students of course there is a teacher guardian for each club who can help if the students need it.",4,3,9.2,80.7,19.87869416,1,0
MIT,"Remarks : The admission process was no hassle at all. It took me less than 10 minutes to apply. In fear of not getting a seat in this institute, I had other options in mind. But fortunately, I was able to secure a seat. Due to the issues of the current pandemic, I was given direct admission and I had no counseling.
Course Curriculum Overview : I had done a 3-year diploma which is related to my current B. Tech course, so a lot of the subjects are quite similar. The student strength of my class is quite low compared to other classes (which is more than 300 by the way). But there are more than enough faculty members to help each and every willing student. The professors I had have at least a master's degree so I can say that the faculty is highly qualified. The online method of teaching has made learning a bit difficult but nevertheless, the professors were helpful. I had done a few subjects offline and I was able to grasp the topics very easily. The coronavirus situation had made a few changes to the exams. They were increased and we had exams almost every day except weekends. The conventional method (offline) is not this harsh.

Internships Opportunities : Again, I'm still a student here. So I'll have to wait until my time comes. The MIT website provides the necessary information. A lot of students have had their internships converted into full-time employment.

Placement Experience : The college website provides adequate information about the placements. I'm currently studying in the institute so I have no experience to share. From what I have seen, the placements are good and they come with a good salary package. The average pay for B.Tech is 3 to 7 lakhs which can increase substantially based on your level of education and skill. The placement data for my course allots up to 70 to 80% of the students. I plan to do an internship which will convert into a placement.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : The cost of education is high but there are a lot of scholarships to choose from. The name of my scholarship is Scholarships for Academy of General Education Students or SAGES for short. To qualify for this scholarship, I had to be a student of a list of 10 to 15 colleges and the fee waiver is 75% which means you pay only 25%.
Campus Life : College life is very rich here at MIT. There's loads of student-friendly infrastructure. There's the Student Plaza (A place exclusive to students which has a fountain ), Marena (It's a gym which also has indoor gaming), a pool, tennis court, badminton court, just to name a few. You'll get to meet a lot of very kind, respectful along people who share the same interest as you. Sadly since I had joined during the pandemic, I was not able to experience the annual fests which my seniors talked about a lot. The faculty provides the notes and books for reference which are more than enough to study. And if that's not enough there's a state-of-the-art library holding thousands and thousands of books. Almost all classrooms are very comfortable and air-cooled. There are only very few of them who are old school. There are enough clubs in manipal to socialize. A lot of them are tech-related since it's an institute of technology. But not to worry there are clubs non-tech related as well.
Hostel Facilities : The quality of the hostels ranges from livable to luxurious. The hostel I had taken was a double room. The cleanliness is maintained every day. There are a lot of food courts and messes to choose from. I had chosen a mess which is near to me. It's called 'Annapoorna'. The quality of the food is quite amazing. There's a variety of nutritious food available with four meals every day. There are vegetarian and non-vegetarian counters available in all messes and food courts. The registration process was simple. I went to the main building (The Edu building) to discuss the payment.

MIT,"Remarks : Basically, I have not applied for any other colleges instead of Manipal Institute of Technology because it is one of the best Engineering Colleges in North-Eastern India and it has set a goal to be a world-class technical institution fostering innovation, leadership and entrepreneurial spirit. The mission of our college is to educate students professionally to face social challenges by providing a healthy learning environment grounded well in the principles of engineering, promoting creativity and nurturing teamwork. Every programme offered by MIT Manipal has different eligibility criteria, these depend on the field as well as the level of the programme. For admission in Btech Programmes candidates must have completed 12th standard or equivalent with Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, English and Chemistry/Biology with a 50% score and the candidates also have to quality the Manipal Entrance Test(MET).
Course Curriculum Overview : I chose to study Information Technology because it focuses on the application of computers and computer software to manage information systems to meet the needs of industry and government. The development, management, and maintenance of Information Technology systems are key competitive factors that are essential for business success in today's world. Our Information Technology department has a student to faculty ratio of 24:1. The teachers have huge experience in the field of teaching and they are always helpful and supportive. Each department has a sufficient number of faculty members. They are eager to solve any doubts that students come up with and a mentor has been assigned to every 20 students in our department, who solves each and every problem that students face whether it is related to academics or non-academics.

Internships Opportunities : Internships are educational and career development opportunities, providing practical experience in a field of discipline. Students can apply for off-campus internships in big companies like Microsoft and Google, and startups like Paytm, Skylabs, Ola, etc. Although getting an internship in a good company is quite competitive as you have to have a strong academic background. But you can easily get internships in startups or small companies. Generally, most of the internships are unpaid and some of them are paid, students can apply for both paid and unpaid internships.
Placement Experience : Students especially become eligible for campus placements from the 6th or 7th semester. They are a lot of big companies that come to our college during the campus placements. Amazon, Delloite, Tata, Fiat, Bosch, Hyundai, Ather Energy, Accenture, Tcs, Royal Enfield, HP, etc. Most of these companies hire for marketing and sales roles, however, tech companies come for market-specific roles. The highest package offered is 12 lakhs per annum by HP and the average package offered by all the companies is 4.33 lakhs per annum. According to the university reports, approximately 80-85% of the students are successful in getting placements.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : The total 4 years fees for my Information Technology course is about INR 3.85 lakhs and there was no fees hike for the past four years. The college charges less than 4 lakhs for each and every undergraduate course, which makes it quite affordable for the students to pay their fees. A few scholarships are also offered by the institute which can be found on their web portal however they are extremely competitive and perfect for deserving candidates. A significant number of students take benefits from the educational loans provided by the banks and the ICICI Bank is affiliated with most of the institute's expenses. Almost all major banks provide a cover of the complete educational expenses at a decent rate of interest. Notable mentions are the State Bank of India, Canara Bank and the ICICI Bank.
Campus Life : The college firmly believes that to enhance the skills of our students, they must be provided with opportunities to explore their creativity. Various cultural programmes are organised several times during the year to encourage creative pursuits and nurture talent. Students form teams and share responsibility for organising the events. The central library of the Manipal Institute of Technology(MIT) is in the heart of the institution and is therefore accessible to students at all times. The three-storey library is fully air-conditioned and occupies a total area of about 70000 sqft and can accommodate 800 users at a time. There are more than 1.5 lakh books, journals, magazines, DVDs and all resources, available for the use of faculty and students. The college has a large student community involved in every activity that is possible to have. From gaming to astronomy dramatics to fine arts, every kind of student group is available on the campus.",2,2,10,54.47,21.51036772,0,0
MIT,"Remarks : The main key point of manipal is the exposure, the diversity and the vast culture. MIT does not do bulk admissions like VIT or any other college. I found that the ranking system was also very transparent and it does not include boards marks for admission, Once you take admission to this college you are going to learn each and every second from 4 years of your life. MIT covers almost every aspect where a teenager wants to live there life.
Course Curriculum Overview : I would say the whole engineering course curriculum including every university present in INDIA needs to be changed, the teacher student ratio is quite good, you can ave personal assistance from the teachers if you need. The college have relative grading, to get the better idea it follows normal distribution curve. The exams are very balanced but more inclined towards the memory basis not the intelligence basis. Anyone who can memorize better rather focusing on understanding the concept, still can mange to pass them.
Class Size : 65
Course Fees : INR 1285000 per year

Internships Opportunities : As I was in the mechanical I didn't get a chance to sit in IT firms but I still manages to get an offer of 7 LPA.

Placement Experience : In manipal the placements are quite high for IT branches which is not a shocking thing you can easily get a placement of about 11LPA, But when it comes to non IT-branches lacement rates and placement packages falls down. although every big company like Goldmansachs, Microsoft, oracle, cisco citrix, amazon visits the campus and the company no exceeds 120.Students get eligible for placements from the 7th sems
Fee Structure And Facilities : The fees of the courses are a bit higher compared to other technical colleges of INDIA. They increase their fees by 10 to 15% every year. It is very disheartening. There are certain scholarships that you can avail like AICTE if your fathers income is less than 6LPA and other one is by scoring the rank below 1000.
Campus Life : AS the manipal is the best place for its exposure and its divesity, I would not doubt for a second that manipal is the best place in INDIA for the social life, If you go to manipal consider yourself lucky.

New Horizon,"Course Curriculum Overview : However, in general, the timing of term exams is usually determined by the institution and is usually specified in their academic calendar or course syllabus. The difficulty of passing exams can also vary depending on a variety of factors such as the subject matter, the level of the course, and the individual student's preparation and understanding of the material. It's also important to note that exam difficulty can vary from year to year based on factors such as the exam content and the level of competition

Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : I haven't got any scholarship These opportunities are typically available to students who are enrolled in higher education institutions. Availability and eligibility requirements for scholarships, financial assistance, and campus jobs with stipends can vary greatly between institutions and can depend on a variety of factors such as academic merit, financial need, and field of study. If you're a student seeking these opportunities, I would recommend reaching out to your institution's financial aid or career services office for more information. I got a campus placement with 4 LPA
Campus Life : Blood bank, sports club, Dance club, Nirvana, Extracurricular activities club, quizzes, Social welfare cause. And no websites run by students All are officially handled and this college is highly chargeable

Some institutions may also require an interview as part of the process. Cutoff scores or grades required for admission can vary greatly between institutions and may change from year to year based on factors such as the number of applicants and the level of competition. It's best to check with the specific institution for the most up-to-date information on their admission requirements and cutoffs",4,5,7.6,56.03,23.32698413,-1,0
New Horizon,"Remarks : Anyone can get into college by writing the KCET or COMEDK. I had written KCET but I rushed for management quota, who has the rank of below 1L in cet can get a seat in NHCE. We usually get the application forms from the admission office the fee and details will be discussed by the staff appointed to you, sometimes you need to book an appointment as there is a crowd during the admission season. I didn't have much of a benefit from my reservation but my friends of mine did get a decent amount cut who were in SC or ST cast. I got a scholarship that said if you have a 75 or above percentage in 12th there will be a 25-35k reduction, as I fell into that category I got the reduction in fees for 1st year. The admission process is really smooth as the staff is having good coordination, but some of my friends had faced issues waiting for a long period since the office was heavily crowded, I would like to see some increase in staff at the peak periods.
Course Curriculum Overview : I have chosen mechanical engineering on the basis of my interest, I liked mechanics ever since childhood. The faculty so far I have seen is really good, and the number is huge too, every teacher is appointed to 3-4 sections so far, so there is not much load on a single teacher and they are plenty in number. The teachers are very cooperative and always try to help students, the teaching methods are up to the mark no compromise in that, teachers look after those who are in need and give extra class if needed.
Class Size : 50
Course Fees : INR 250000 per year

Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : The fees are a fairly good prices, one can definitely earn back their investments in little more than 3-4 years. I am talking about all the streams. If someone is coming to college by the management quota they might have a hard time getting a return on investment, the donation is really high if they go in at the last moment, I am sure it's the same everywhere. There are so many opportunities in placements, the students are well prepared for their jobs as they provide compulsory internships, so by the end of last year, everyone is well prepared. Job placements are really good, more than 5 students got the packages of 20L last year 1 got 30L as well, although it's tough for the mechanical course, the placement in mechanical is kinda poor sure is more than enough for those who get it, The placements in others streams are amazing, especially computer science its 100% placement. I personally am happy because there is a possibility for mech students to get placed in Germany France or japan.
Campus Life : There is Sargam fest which is an annual fest, NHCE is well known for Sargam fest, which is conducted in Nov. There are tons of activities you can do during fests. Almost all the books are available in the library, u might need to do a hustle for borrowing the book sometimes otherwise they are mostly available in the library. The classrooms are good all the facilities are available including the smart boards, there are sufficient benches for students and they are fairly comfortable. There are way too many extracurricular activities, there are plenty of options for a student, the clubs are very good and are unique in their own ways, all the clubs are friendly and there are so many constant activities going on the campus. All the information is also available on the website of NHCE college. Overall the infrastructure and the social life are absolutely insane, I personally like it a lot since the college is friendly.

Application forms, fees, and dates can be found on the official website of New Horizon or one can visit the college for the same. The admission process is perfect and requires no improvement.
Course Curriculum Overview : I chose Mechanical Engineering to pursue my interest in getting a job in the automotive field once I graduate. The faculty is very good and are readily available to help students. Almost all the faculties have good qualifications and have a wide knowledge of their respective subject. The final exams of the 2nd semester were difficult and very hectic because the semester was completed within just three months and the practical exams were right before the theory exams and thus gave us very little to no time to revise the portions of the 2nd semester. This combined with the change in the pattern of the papers made it slightly difficult to expect what type of questions would be asked in the exam.
Class Size : 60
Course Fees : INR 150000 per year
Internships Opportunities : There are plenty of internship opportunities available that students can opt for once they reach the 6th semester.

Working on projects and getting experience by participating in club activities and workshops are a bonus for the resume which can help in getting the required job.

Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : Fees are high in all the courses due to the donation. The cost to study is high if one opts for a management quota. If one gets a college seat through an entrance exam like KCET or through sports quota, then the fees are relatively lesser as you will get scholarships.
Campus Life : Sargam is conducted every year in November and another fest named Sargam was conducted earlier this year in June. Tech fests and events are conducted from time to time by the clubs in the college which are organized by students.

There are plenty of sports and extracurricular activities conducted regularly. Every month there are at least 3 to 4 sports events and club events from which students can participate and earn certificates.

New Horizon,"Remarks : I got in through 3rd round CET to NHCE in the electronics and communication branch. The admission process was pretty smooth. They made sure the process of onboarding into the college went seamlessly. But one back draw was that they initially asked us to pay 10K for reserving the seat, I was waiting for my NEET results to come out, I secured a management seat in Akash medical college, but the college didn't agree to give my certificates back, they demanded me to pay the whole of 4yr fee, and only after that they would get my certificates back. This was really unfair, since I had no option financially at that point in time, paying 4yrs fee together was an impossible task, therefore, I had to continue in the same college I had registered. This is my admission process story. The college is very money-oriented and they make sure to scam students the money in all the possible ways, suddenly in the 2nd year, the fee had increased by 6000 saying it would be would to build a new block. It's autonomous.
Course Curriculum Overview : To be honest it wasn't hard at all to pass off. Since it's an autonomous institution, they are the ones who prepare the question paper and there are the ones who correct it too. We have something called question bank and questions used to come only from this question bank. Passing was not a big deal at all due to this reason. The quality of the syllabus planned as well wasn't good enough to meet the requirements of the trending technologies. They even deliberately fail students so that they can make money out of fast-track and makeup exams. We used to have 3 internals in a sem and a final Sem end exam as well.
Class Size : 80
Course Fees : INR 100000 per year

Internships Opportunities : The college itself doesn't provide internship facilities by the college does have tie-ups with few companies that provide internship facilities to students. Again the stipend is given only to few selected companies which are usually around 12000 per month. I myself have been into a machine learning internship and learned how to draw important insights from huge datasets.
Placement Experience : The students start getting trained at the end of 3rd sem itself. There are over 150 companies that provide placement opportunities to students at NHCE. The highest package range is around 24L and the lowest is around 3.5L. The students are expected not to have any backlogs or Fastrack subjects to be pending. And an average of 75% of CGPA is expected to be maintained for the placement purpose is placed at a very reputed company and I'm happy.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : To be honest they initially didn't provide any scholarships with respect to merit. Lastly in the 4rth year government got in an SSP portal scholarship which provided us with scholarships up to 18000. When it comes to job opportunities, our college did have nice campus placement offers .and I myself got placed for a package of 8.24L in Lowe's company as a fresher.
Campus Life : There is an official website that is maintained by the student committee itself to inform the ongoing events at the college. They do have an alumni platform where we students of different batches can stay connected in the future. There are many NGOs and clubs that organize blood donation camps to help people every year. We often visit vrudashrams as well and give some musical concerts to make them feel special and help them financially if possible as well.",8,10,8.2,75.54,17.66190476,-2,0

Course Curriculum Overview : Computer Science and Engineering was always the first preference for me as I was more into subject compared to other subjects, right from the start. Faculty : Student ratio would roughly be 1: 20. Most of the faculty are either Masters or PhD in the subject they teach, teaching method ranges from traditional to modern based on the experience of the faculty.

Class Size : 80
Course Fees : INR 225000 per year

Internships Opportunities : All companies that come for placements to offer full-time oppurtunities also offer internships as the first step to enter their company. Usually the final/major project is considered for placements and to train us for it, we also have mini projects every semester in different domains.
Placement Experience : Students are eligible for placements from the end of 6th semester itself, previous batch records display 30 companies visited the campus and 14 of which offered atleast 1 offer to a student with highest package of 19.14L from Lowe's India. Companies visited and highest package offered: TCS: 6L Infosys: 6L Cognizant: 8L Lowe's India: 19.14L L&TI: 4L Cerner Corporation: 3L Quest Global: 3L and many more Out of 300 students in CSE department, 119 have been placed already. I plan to attend placements and join a corporate firm right after my degree.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : Cost to study in New Horizon College is as followed: Management quota: 2.25L/annum KCET quota: 1.5L/annum The college provides 100% placement assistance but I haven't recieved any offer as placements start from the end of 6th semester.
Campus Life : New Horizon College of Engineering hosts one of the largest college fests in Bangalore named 'Sargam', Sargam is usually hosted in the month of September. Tech fests are held every semester with different clubs hosting them. The college has 2 ibraries, and one of it is accesible 24 hours a day, The library really helps for finding books related to the course. Classrooms are equipped with a traditional black board and a white board beside it, Benches are wooden with cuishioned seats and can hold 4 students comfortably. Ventillation is properly maintained with suitably placed windows. Our Campus has sports facilities like basketball, Volleyball, Cricket, Football, indoor basketball court, board games, table tennis and many more, the campus also has 2 gym facilities - one indoor and one outdoor.

The college also has student clubs run by students in every department like Green warriors club, Drama club",3,6,8,64.39,20.37210757,-3,0
New Horizon,"Remarks : Good aspect was it was a well known autonomous college. I got in there through KCET so I had to follow the govt procedures for the admission purpose I had paid 50k govt fee and 46500 was the college fee so total of 96500. I chose this college cause it had BE- AUTOMOBILE , it was an autonomous college and was situated right in the city . The infrastructure is very good .
Course Curriculum Overview : The teachers are well qualified with good experience in the subject . I chose BE-AUTOMOBILE cause I was fascinated to know the systems and the working of an automobile . We had internals every month end so the sem was 3 months long and the 4th month was the sem exam . It was easy to pass since it was autonomous the syllabus had only things which are required .
Class Size : 74
Course Fees : INR 96500 per year

Internships Opportunities : No intership is provided by the college . But it is mandatory to complete internship in the 7th semester and we have to submit report and documents of the same . It was a 4 credit subject so we have to find it by our own and complete the course .
Placement Experience : Students are eligible for placements from the 6th semester. From 6th sem end the placement training starts . Firms like IBM, AMAZON,FLIPKART, COGNIZANT, CAPGEMINI and many more have visited the campus . But the placements and very much biased to the software related course students like CS and IS the opportunities for core companies for other branches are poor .
Fee Structure And Facilities : I got in through KCET so I had no fee hikes in any semesters . The topper of each department is given a scholarship every year . I got no job through campus . The placements for our dept was poor whereas for CS , IS the opportunities where a lot and had really good placements . Not a college for good placements in mech and auto.
Campus Life : The college had one of the best fests conducted in the city called SARGAM which happens during the month of September . All dept had tech fests conducts at different times of the year . The classroom are preety much normal nothing great .
Admission : No interview for addmission. For both KCET and management seat there was no test or interview . While taking admission if the 12th scores are good some discounts were given based on the percentage scored and it was direct admission for all.",9,0,6.9,79.52,15.8578292,9,0
New Horizon,"Remarks : Because I had less percentage in 12th and this college allowed me. Plus the fee was moderate. As per the college the campus placement was a great option and 100% for last 3 years, but It was 90 - 93%. The education structure was looking good and as I was not very good at studying and exams so for that they had the option of extra training for back-locks. This season goes during your year ending break, during the holidays you will have to attend class. This is a 2 month season and you will have all the internal exams and assignment to complete and in the end the final exams will be conducted, which is your back subject exams. This is basically a whole semester shrink to 2 months and for only the subjects you failed in the exams. But this season is compulsory to clear the subjects and it cost's a lot, it's expensive. For people who live in hostel will have to pay the hostel fee too for staying in the hostel during this season. My overall experience was okay, I mean it's a fine college and the fee was not that too high, but there will be other expenses which makes it a little expensive.
Course Curriculum Overview : Course and Curriculum were good, but the structure was not good, and at the end I did not learn much, for exams too I had to relay on youtube and other websites to learn. We did get notes but it was longgg. Too long sometime. The overall experience was more about theoretical and not practical.
Class Size : 62
Course Fees : INR 760000 per year

Internships Opportunities : I had my Internships outside college, college had a subject for Internship. So to clear that you will have to get an Internship, college do not provide for any Internship. One good thing is that this is during your final semester of final year, so If you are placed during that time, and you can get an Internship from the company you are placed, that will work and you will not have to get an external internship. I was lucky to get an Internship in a startup company so I did get to learn a lot and was a great experience.
Placement Experience : For campus placements you will be charged extra for the training which is compulsory to attend or you will have to sign a contract saying that ""You are not looking for campus placements"". The training is good, I would suggest that. It's a good process and you will learn how to crack exams and handle interviews. And also, companies have there own eligibility criteria. So college cannot help with that, you will be allowed to sit for companies whose criteria you are clearing. Also you will be charged some amount after getting place, like 8 to 9k even if you join the company or not.
Fee Structure And Facilities : Free structure was 175,000 for normal, and 190,000 for professional. I wouldn't suggest taking the professional course. Better use the 15,000 for online courses in platform like udemy or cousera. Let me explain below. The difference was that there will be a extra Course which will be held during the semester period. Well it wasn't extra, it was held during regular college hours so you will have to skip your regular classes to be able to attend this courses. But you will get attendance. It's all practical and will actually learn something from this. I say something because the college facility did not support course. What I mean is for example if it was an android studio course, the systems available for this course won't have pre installed with software and the system and internet was really slow so from 8 days of course we had to spend 2 days just to download and install the software. Nd then sometimes the software also crashed. We had to switch to our own laptops. And for scholarships only students from karnataka and CET exams will get the scholarship.
Campus Life : Campus was great, it's a small campus, but it's good. They have gym, library and food courts. The only problem was It was only during college hours, every thing is closed on sunday, only hostel food in available.
Admission : No, there was only a group discussion where they asked about the about your 12% and they explain how everything works in there college. They will not tell everything in that discussion, so be details with your question and ask every thing so they don't hide anything from you.",8,7,6.4,84.71,15.16102187,1,0
New Horizon,"Remarks : I choose this college because my elder brother refers me to this college and the review, grade and even ranking of this college are good in Karnataka state that's why I chose this college, and even semester exam pattern and internal exam pattern is very tough and I want that kind of study. Even placement review is very much interesting about this college. The admission process was very easier and by giving only booking amount of Rs. 50000 for admission and direct admission is there with kmat entrance exam score which they will arrange in between semester.
Course Curriculum Overview : I choose MBA because I want to do make my life professional and make a way for my future career. There was more than 20 staff who teach us and the faculty were more friendly towards us and their teaching concepts were amazing and essay to learn things. Our batch was divided into sections wise that are A, B&C. In each section 60 students were there and in each section 10 faculty were there.

Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : Fee Structure was clearly mentioned year-wise and fees we should pay in 2 installments and they ate charged exams fees also before the exam and there is a hike of 10 % in exam fees according to semester wise and even hike in hostel price of 2nd year that is also 20% I think. There will be a management quota and if you took admission through quota then u will get a 15000 scholarship and you are from Karnataka state or u gave kmat exam and took admission through the merit list then your fee will be less than the management quota and you will get 50% scholarship in the fee.

Hostel Fee : INR 115000 per year
Interview Experience : No, I did not give any GD, Interview, or written test because I took admission from the management quota and I already gave Xat entrance exam. If u did not take any cat, xat, and mat exams then they will provide opportunities for kmat entrance exams in between semester exams regarding keeping a record for admission process.",3,7,9.1,68.61,19.52508653,-4,0

NITK,"Remarks : Well, as this is an NIT college, so to get entry into any NIT college, we have to clear the entrance exams named JEE MAINS. Basically, this exam is conducted by NIC to get admission to IIT colleges. To get entry into IIT college, one must clear both JEE MAINS AND JEE ADVANCE exams. But if you have scored good marks in JEE MAINS, then you are allowed to get admission to good NIT colleges and NITK is one of them. The application form can be found on the official website of NIC, where they release a form every year to allow let students to fill out and get prepared for their JEE MAINS exams. As NIT colleges are famous for their extraordinary benefits like good faculty, scholarships, and good placements, so this college does provide any benefits to the reservation candidates. I personally don't want to see any changes in the admission process, as this is quite simple. You have to clear the entrance exam and then you will be called for an interview.
Course Curriculum Overview : I scored good marks in my JEE MAINS exam, so I get into this college with a mechanical branch, and I was very excited to get into this college because this college is famous for its good faculty and good placements. I have selected this course because I want to become a successful mechanical engineer in big companies like Mahindra, IFB etc. I choose NITK because the college is the best in engineering, the placement is quite excellent and the education levels are very high in this college. Now, if I talk about the faculty-student ratio, then it's quite balanced. There are approx 85-90 students in each class and there are 2-3 faculty or teachers for each subject. The exams are held twice in a semester, one is mid-term and another is the main semester exam. The exams are not that difficult to pass, as it depends on the hard work of the students. It becomes hard for those who don't care about their studies.
Class Size : 95
Course Fees : INR 153000 per year

Placement Experience : Generally, students from 3rd semester become eligible for campus placement or off-campus placement, it depends on the student quality. The placement quality of this college cannot be questioned, because the institution is the best engineering college in terms of faculty and placements. The college has a track record of above 85% selection. The highest package offered was Rs 45 lakh per annum, the lowest package offered was Rs 3.5 lakh per annum and the average package of NITK is Rs 21.4 lakh per annum. Among the top recruiters are BHEL, Mahindra, Infosys, Wipro etc. Well, if I get a good placement from this college, then I will serve myself as a mechanical engineer in the top companies mentioned above. And if it doesn't executes, then I will go for higher studies in my branch.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : If I talk about this course fee, then it's rs 1.5 lakh per year which includes two semesters of 5-6 months each. The fee is a little bit costly but it's not that big of an issue for the students studying in this college, because poor students can clear all the costs to spend on them with the help of good placements provided by this college. The college provides good placement opportunities to the students. The scholarship is based on merit and financial need through schemes like institute, merit - cum - means scholarships, institute-free studentship, and SC/ST scholarships. Also, this college will help you take the scholarship provided by your local government. You have to just fill up the form, and just have to submit the form to the college. The college will further proceed with your form to the government.
Campus Life : The campus of this college is culturally diverse as we have a golden opportunity to learn various types of things from different - different people all over India as well as the world. Various types of fests are conducted by the students of this college including annual fests, tech fests etc. The tech fests are conducted by the students of the computer science branch. Sarang is the technological fest held by computer science students, where we can get to show off our innovative ideas. The library of this college is very big and fully air-conditioned which further includes free wifi for 24 hours. The college library also has international research journals and various types of books are available from various types of authors and writers. The same thing is with the lab, the lab consists of various types of computers with windows 11 and their is free wifi available in the lab also. The research facilities are modern and outfitted with a wide range of research tools.
Hostel Facilities : NITK has a total of 10 hostels, out of which 6 are for boys and 4 are for girls. NITK's hostel is one of the most luxurious hostels. The hostel also provides free wifi 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The food at the hostel is excellent as well as hygienic, and the menu is extensive. The rooms are available in both single and double occupancy. The hostel's discipline is excellent. No one is allowed to get outside without permission. The wardens at the hostel are extremely professional. There are also sports facilities available. Holi, Diwali, Pongal, Christmas day ,new year's eve are also celebrated at the hostel. You have to fill out and submit the registration form with the instalment mentioned, then you are given the room accordingly and hence you will get entry into the hostel premises.
Hostel Fee : INR 45000 per year",7,9,9.5,74.65,16.30958684,-2,0
NITK,"Remarks : Admission to NITK and almost all other esteemed colleges is through JOSAA Counselling. We have to apply for JOSAA counselling after clearing JEE MAINS examination. All the application process was online. There were multiple rounds of counselling where we have to select our college preferences, we get a seat in a college based on our rank in JEE MAINS. Application forms, fees and dates everything will be mentioned on the JOSAA website, students should regularly visit the site daily at least twice to get regular updates in the counselling phase. There will be separate seats reserved for OBC, SC, ST, PWD, EWS and GIRLS. Separate ranks and seats will be given to the students who are eligible for this counselling. Everything was done so smoothly, but students have to be very careful and clear with their selection and choices in counselling because even a small mistake can't be reverted and your whole year and hard work will be wasted.
Course Curriculum Overview : I chose this course because of my interest in chemical engineering. There will be 1 faculty for a particular course for every 60-70 students (depending on the branch). The faculties here are highly qualified and experienced, they have a huge knowledge of their subject and can solve any doubts which you have. The teaching method of some professors is not so good, because most of the time students may not understand what is going on in the class. The exams are a little tough, and more conceptual. You have to listen to the class properly and take advice from seniors for every particular course. Some courses are so tough that you will think of just passing them somehow.
Class Size : 68
Course Fees : INR 124000 per year

Internships Opportunities : Many companies which offer placements also come for internships. But the number of students they pick for an internship is very less, most of the companies are software side, and less than 30 students will get an internship in core companies. So many students do an internship under our college professors such as research interns. You can work under any professor by requesting them and gaining knowledge from the project they are doing. Opportunities are huge for internships also but you have to move out of your comfort zone and explore.
Placement Experience : Students are eligible for campus placements after their 6th semester. The selection process is done online in IRIS Portal and by Career Development Centre. More than 200 companies visit every year. The selection process and eligibility depend on company to company. The highest package is 50lpa and the average package is around 11lpa. Almost all students who apply for placements get placed in some or the other company. I plan to work in a big MNC and do business side by side.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : The fee structure of the hostel, mess, campus facilities, and annual course fees is pretty decent. There is no tuition fees policy for SC, ST, and people with less family annual income. There is a huge number of scholarships released every semester by other companies and organizations. Our college has a merit scholarship for every semester. Stipends and jobs on campus will be given to M.Tech and Ph.D. students only, not to B.Tech students.
Campus Life : We have an annual fest and tech fest every year. The annual fest called ""INCIDENT"" will be conducted in the even semester and the tech fest called ""ENGINEER"" will be conducted in the odd semester. The availability of books is less according to me because whenever I tried to issue a particular book that will be already taken by other students. Our campus should focus on an increasing number of books. Most of the Classrooms are gallery-type and very neat. We have all sports available here but the number of courts for example badminton and TT courts are fewer, you have to wait for at least 1hr for your turn to play. Extracurricular activities are huge in number, every week there will be some or other thing going on on campus, and it depends on your interests to participate. There are many clubs on campus like ISTE, IET, ACM, IEEE, ROTARACT, and UTKRISHT BHARAT which all are run by students. I suggest you be a part of any of the clubs as it helps in interacting with others, guidance, and increasing your contacts.
Hostel Facilities : We have single rooms, double sharing, and triple sharing available on the campus. That can't be chosen, they are provided to students according to their class and course and in which sem they are in. You will get a study table, fan, cupboard, and high-speed internet facility available in hostels. Washrooms are dirty most of the time and it depends on students of the particular wings to keep them clean. I don't think you can get these many items on the menu as much as our college is providing. The quality depends on the mess you take, you should not expect to get a home quality food here. Registration for a hostel is also done online in IRIS Portal which every student will be provided according to their registration numbers. The fees of the the Hostel are affordable.
Hostel Fee : INR 9200 per year",10,15,7.5,76.68,16.55159759,-5,0
NITK,"Remarks : This college accepts only Joint Entrance Exam (JEE) as the criteria for admission. The course eligibility depends on your rank on this exam. Applications for NITs and IITs are centralized by Josaa, on their online application portal. Reservation benefits also apply to OBC, SC/ST, and PwD.
Course Curriculum Overview : I have been interested in metallurgy and hence I chose this course. The faculty-student ratio is 1:50. The faculty are well qualified and teach quite well. But the culture of running through the PPTs still persists to this day. The term exams were timely enough, although could have been more spaced out to provide students enough time to study. The exams were of moderate difficulty.
Class Size : 45
Course Fees : INR 150000 per year
Internships Opportunities : The internship opportunities in this college for the metallurgy department are not up to the mark. Very few companies visit our department. But for the circuit branches, the opportunities are vast. The stipend varies from 20,000 per month to 90,000 per month.

Placement Experience : From the 7th semester, students become eligible for placements. The highest package is 54lpa Palo-Alto. The average package is around 12 LPA. Around 98% of placement record is held by the college. I received a placement in o9 solutions for 10 LPA.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : The fee hike was unacceptable. Students of merit do not receive any scholarships or financial assistance, since they do not fall under the 5 lakh or 1 lakh income category, which is preposterous. The students in the reserved category have to pay no tuition fees, which again is a ridiculous proposition. I got a job at o9 solutions with a 10 lakh CTC.
Campus Life : Engineer is the tech fest conducted during September (odd semester) and Incident is the annual fest conducted during the even semester (March). The classrooms in some departments are in pathetic condition, but most of them are being renovated. The library is well stocked with books and journals from various publishers. All the clubs in our college (ACM, IE, IEEE, etc) have functioning websites and conduct events throughout the year. Sports and extracurricular activities are encouraged.",9,4,6.5,81.45,16.91848739,5,0
NITK,"Remarks : Eligibility for any course in NITK for Indian citizens living in India is through the JEE Main. I got a 17k AIR in JEE Main to get Civil under the Other State category. I did not avail any reservation benefits. I'm a General category student. Application is done through JoSAA counseling. The document verification and admission process took place on campus in NITK, it was easy because they informed us what to bring before hand.
Course Curriculum Overview : I chose civil engineering in my first year because of my genuine interest. Civil engineering is taught very well by professors who have very good industry knowledge and subject knowledge. The professors help you a lot when you seek help. In matters like LORs etc. for foreign universities, internships. The LORs of NITK professors have very good weightage. Usually, the exams are roughly spanned like Quiz 1, Midsem, Quiz 2, and Ends. Ends have 50% weightage. These exams are conducted at regular intervals. They're not very difficult to score well in even if you study the night before.
Class Size : 100
Course Fees : INR 140000 per year

Internships Opportunities : Many companies come for internships too but their intake is much lesser and they may not be open to every branch. Many people have landed very good jobs despite not getting any internships. The stipend is anywhere between 20k to 2.5 Lakhs pm (Uber) for the interns. Most of the interns receive a PPO. If they accept they'll be relaxed for the whole final year.
Placement Experience : You're eligible for placements from the 7th sem. Internship eligibility is from the 5th sem. Till Oct end close to 160 companies visited with 80% of B.Tech strength already placed. One offer per student is allowed. PSUs also come towards the end of the 7th sem and the beginning of the 8th sem for which everyone in the eligible branch is allowed even the ones who are already placed. Companies like Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Palo Alto, Morgan Stanley, etc. came with Palo Alto giving the highest package of 54LPA. The average package could be close to 13 LPA.
Loan/ Scholarship Provisions : The fees are the only pain point for those of us who don't come under any reservation benefit. It's close to 1 lakh per semester and 2 lakh per year. A fee hike is seen with every graduating batch. Thankfully, there are many scholarships by the alumni, Birla, OPJEMS scholarship, etc. if you have a decent CGPA that you need to look out for.
Campus Life : The technical fest is Engineer held in the odd semester and the cultural fest is Incident held in the even semester, Incident is the second largest in India only second to Mood Indigo IITB. Both of these are fully student-run which will improve your management, communication and negotiation skills. The sporting culture in NITK is decent. The inter-NIT competitions are taken seriously and practice goes on for days. Books are available in the library on a first come first serve basis. So make sure you go to the library early in the semester to get all recommended books by the professors. The classrooms are well equipped. There are 27 student clubs IN NITK, with 6 exclusives. Besides teaching you technically they are a good add-on to your resume and help you in your HR rounds. You can inflate about your roles and responsibilities in the clubs. So make sure you join at least 2 clubs.
Hostel Facilities : The hostel for first-year girls is GH-3 Yamuna which has 3 shared rooms. It looks old but doesn't let looks deceive you. It's the most happening hostel in GH and has no power cuts and good internet connectivity. GH-5 are the newer modern hostels but they have no Wi-Fi and we rely only on LAN. There are 2 messes for veg and nonveg in the Girl's block. Both of them offer really good food which is better than any other hostel food you'll eat. It becomes monotonous but the food is tasty and nutritious. Hostel registration is done on the IRIS portal including the mess from the second semester.

Internships Opportunities : The company comes to the college for an internship after the 4th semester which provides paid internships with stipends ranging from 20k to 150k. Also, the students can get pre-placement offers from the company before the placement season.

There are so many companies that came here to provide the placement here like Oracle, Microsoft Amazon, Google, etc come here to provide an internship in the role of side and analyst, etc. Also, the core companies come here with a good package.

Campus Life : Life at the campus is very good also the seniors here are very cooperative and provide us well guidance. Also, there are so many clubs like robotics, Baja racing, etc which are run by the students in the college.",2,6,9.8,73.95,18.75009042,-4,0
NITK,"Remarks : I got a reservation by EWS and it's good to have EWS if you have one because by this you can get a good branch like one or two branches of upper rank. I got into this college by giving JEE mains exam and then after JOSAA counseling, I got NITK.
Course Curriculum Overview : The qualifications of the faculties are good as they all did their Ph.D. from the premier institutes of this universe. And also the passing criteria are also good here as we get relative marks. The student-to-teacher ratio is quite good, every teacher welcomes you for clearing your doubt or whatever it is.
